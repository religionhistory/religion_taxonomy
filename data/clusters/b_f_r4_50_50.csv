1.1,858_ENR,858_ENR,858,"Elite, Religious Specialists, Non-elite (common people, general populace)","The New Prophecy or ""Montanism""",Database of religion history (DRH),"The New Prophecy refers to the Christian prophetic movement led by the prophets Montanus, Maximilla, and Priscilla. Later known as ""Montanism,"" the movement began in the second half of the second century CE in Roman Phrygia, which is in the west-central part of Anatolia, present-day Turkey. It quickly spread beyond Phrygia and, by the mid-third century, had reached Rome, Carthage, Thrace, and Gaul. By the early fifth century, no adherents of the New Prophecy movement remained in North Africa (Optatus of Milevis, Against the Donatists 1.9; Augustine Letter 118.12) or Rome (Praedestinatus, 1.86). In the mid-sixth century, Emperor Justinian I's forces, led by John of Ephesus, attacked Pepouza and burned the group's literature, bringing a decisive end to the already dwindling New Prophecy in Asia Minor. 
 

  The New Prophecy was controversial. Critics took issue with the movement's ascetic rigor, eschatological beliefs, and the prominent role women played in leading it. However, the most significant source of controversy was the ecstatic prophecies the group's adherents claimed to receive from the Holy Spirit. The movement proclaimed their prophecies constituted supplementary divine revelations with equal or greater authority than those of the previous apostolic traditions. Like the apostle Paul, the New Prophecy, thus, appealed to divine visions as the source of their familiarity with and authorization from Christ. As such, the prophetic movement posed an aggravating challenge to contemporaneous Christian groups whose authority rested entirely upon apostolic succession. 
 

  In the late third century, the movement was condemned as a heresy. The term ""Montanism"" was bestowed by fourth-century heresiologists. Later commentators also called adherents of the New Prophecy Cataphrygians, Pepouzians, Quintillianists, and Priscillianists. Scholars have traditionally referred to the New Prophecy movement of the second and third centuries as ""Montanism,"" despite the fact that it is a fourth-century neologism and imbues connotations of heresy not associated with the movement until the late third century. 
 

  The New Prophecy is known almost exclusively through the third- and fourth-century heresiological accounts of the movement's opponents. These sources also provide fourteen oracles, which scholars believe are genuine expressions of the New Prophecy. A few inscriptions and Tertullian's early third-century writings constitute the only evidence for New Prophecy that survives independently of heresiological texts. Identifying specific texts from Tertullian's corpus as ""Montanist"" has prompted scholars to take Tertullian's views as representative of the broader New Prophecy movement. However, scholars have debated the extent to which Tertullian's early third-century writings represent the New Prophecy movement and its teachings. Several of Tertullian's so-called ""Montanist"" works convey idiosyncratic thoughts that are not consistent with the other evidence for the movement. As such, Tertullian must be treated exclusively as a witness to the New Prophecy's Carthaginian reception in the first decades of the third century and not representative of Montanism elsewhere or at other times.","Religious Group[8] -> Roman Religions[900], Religious Group[8] -> Early Christianity[774], Religious Group[8], Religious Group[8] -> Anatolian Religions[10], Religious Group[8] -> Montanism[972], Religious Group[8] -> New Prophecy[973], Religious Group[8] -> Apocalyptic Movements[846], Religious Group[8] -> Rome[974], Religious Group[8] -> Gaul[975], Religious Group[8] -> Carthage[976], Religious Group[8] -> Christian Traditions[18], Religious Group[8] -> Tertullian[977], Religious Group[8] -> Phrygia[978], Religious Group[8] -> Prophecy[979], Religious Group[8] -> Heresy[854], Religious Group[8] -> Asia Minor[981], Religious Group[8] -> Roman Religious Traditions[42]",Camille Leon Angelo,1024,Locations of the New Prophecy,The regions of the Mediterranean with New Prophecy communities in Late Antiquity.,"Africa[14], Central Asia[367], Asia Minor[434]",E,N,R,1,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,1,1,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,0,1,0,1,1,0,0,1,1,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,1,0,1,1,1,0,1,1
1.1,564_N,564_N,564,"Non-elite (common people, general populace)",Tribal Christianity (and allied castes) in the Himalayas,Database of religion history (DRH),"The tribal Christian population of the high Himalayas and low-lying hills spans five countries (India, Nepal, Pakistan, Bhutan and China) and contested boarderlands (Tibet, Sikkim, Aksai Chin and Kashmir, among others). It encompasses approximately 6 million people. The largest Christian tribal populations are 4.9 million converted Baptists, Presbyterians and Catholics in Northeast India and 375,000 Evangelical Protestants in Nepal (a figure sometimes rounded up to 1 million) -- arguably the fastest-growing Christian population in the world. Small but important Christian tribal communities are in Bhutan, Sikkim, Ladakh, Himachal Pradesh, Uttarakhand, and Jammu and Kashmir. The historical timeline of tribal conversion to Christianity depends on the region and date of missionary penetration into the hills. The Portuguese Jesuit João Cabral was arguably the first European to access the Himalayan region in 1627 with missionary designs. Since then, thousands of missionaries have come into the Himalayan region, from the London-based Church Missionary Society (Punjab region through the 20th century) to the recent explosion of South Korean missionaries populating language institutes and centered in the Kathmandu Valley. Indigenous house churches have sprouted up in remote tribal villages. Himalayan tribal Christianity falls into a broad spectrum of official affiliation. Some expressions of tribal Christianity are largely indigenous and invisible; they address local aspirations and offer respite from spiritual affliction and caste discrimination within circumscribed tribal cosmologies and social stratifications. Other expressions of tribal Christianity are hooked into international NGOs and global ideoscapes promoting salvation that are backed by foreign patronage and theological instruction; they are networked through social media platforms and employ a range of conversion techniques associated with Western (and South Korean) Evangelicalism. In some cases, tribal Christianity in the Himalayas allows discriminated-against Dalit groups who are embedded within tribal formations to find self-respect and social validation within the new idiom of salvation and equality under Yesu Masih (Jesus Christ). Although Christians are persecuted throughout South Asia, overt violence against the minority religion is not as strongly evident in the Himalayan tribal range as it is in Pakistan and non-Himalayan India states (especially Tamil Nadu, Uttar Pradesh, Chhattisgarh and Odisha, where in 2007-08 in Kandhamal District 50 Christians were killed and 95 churches burned down). The rise of right-wing Hindutva politics since 2014 and the disproportionate criminalization of Christian conversion as coercive have pushed Christianity further into the social margins everywhere through India, including the Himalayan tribal belt. As would be expected, Christian tribals in the Himalayas are not strongly unified around their minority religious status; divided by language, geography and often theology and sectarian affiliation, they are sometimes balkanized into subdividing communities. Nevertheless, they are conceptually and anthropologically interconnected as a Pan-Himalayan community of faith, spiritual aspiration and unique forms of theological syncretism.","Religious Group[8] -> Christian Traditions[18], Religious Group[8] -> Christian Traditions[18] -> Catholic[153], Religious Group[8] -> Christian Traditions[18] -> Anglican[146], Religious Group[8] -> Christian Traditions[18] -> Himalayan Christianity[823], Religious Group[8] -> Christian Traditions[18] -> Tribal Christianity[824], Religious Group[8] -> Christian Traditions[18] -> Dalit Christianity[825], Religious Group[8] -> Christian Traditions[18] -> Protestantism[826], Religious Group[8]",Stephen Christopher,799,Himalayan tribal Christianity (and tribal-allied groups),"The spread of Christianity (predominately Anglican, Catholic and United Evangelical Lutheran) into the Himalayan region and among tribal and tribal-aligned communities at its greatest extant in the contemporary period.","Asia[1], Asia[1] -> South Asia[40], Asia[1] -> South Asia[40] -> Nepal[218], Asia[1] -> South Asia[40] -> Bhutan[214], Asia[1] -> South Asia[40] -> India[215], Asia[1] -> South Asia[40] -> India[215] -> North India[351], Asia[1] -> Himalayas[363], Asia[1] -> South Asia[40] -> India[215] -> Northeast India[362]",NA,N,NA,1,0,1,1,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,0,0,1,1,1,1,0,1,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,1,1

1.1,873_EN,873_EN,873,"Elite, Non-elite (common people, general populace)",The Branch Davidians,Database of religion history (DRH),"The Branch Davidians were a millenarian sect active in the United States from 1960’s through 1993. The group developed out of a Seventh-Day Adventist offshoot called the Davidian Adventists, which believed itself to be the pure remnant of a now-global Adventist church that had grown lax and sinful. In contrast to Adventist understandings that the Kingdom of God would come about through a spiritual transformation of the world, the Davidians taught that the Kingdom of God would be physically established by a second Christ in the modern-day land of Palestine. In 1935, the Davidians moved to a large farm in Waco, TX, from which they proselytized (mainly by mail) about the imminent return of Christ.
 

 After the death of Davidian founder Victor Houteff in 1955 (and after Christ failed to materialize on the day that Houteff’s widow predicted in 1959) the group began to splinter, and by the early 1960’s it re-coalesced around members Ben and Lois Roden, who both eventually assumed the mantle as prophets and renamed the group the “Branch Davidians.” In 1981, a recent convert named Vernon Howell began to stake claims to the prophetic role that Lois Roden still held. Out of the power struggles that followed Roden’s death in the mid-1980s, Howell emerged the clear leader of the Branch Davidians. After a trip to Israel where he claimed to have had a vision of angelic forces, in 1990 he legally changed his name to David Koresh and began to teach that he was a second Christ sent to complete the mission that Jesus had started by ushering in the end of days. 
 

 Koresh and a group of over 100 followers lived communally at Mount Carmel, their compound in Waco, Texas. There, members participated in lengthy daily Bible studies led by Koresh. They believed that he had been sent by God to reveal the full meaning of the Christian Bible, and in particular, to unfold the narrative of the imminent apocalypse. They believed the apocalypse would be triggered by a conflict between the Branch Davidians and the forces of “Babylon” that would take place in the land of Palestine at some point in the near future. Aiming to purify themselves in preparation for the end of days, they sought to live as a perfect community; they came to see themselves as a divine family, with adults spiritually married to Koresh and all of the children spiritually his – and many of them biologically his own, as well. 
 

 In the spring of 1993, when federal agents – legally spurred by an arrest warrant for Koresh on weapons charges, but also deeply motivated by fears driven by the anti-cult movement – began a violent siege on the group’s compound. After 51 days, the compound went up in flames, killing 76 Branch Davidians, including Koresh. The movement was effectively ended, though some believers survived, and though some other groups have risen up to claim the name of Branch Davidian. Some elements of life at Mount Carmel remain contested to this day, with conflicting reports from members and disaffected ex-members emerging during and after the siege.","Religious Group[8] -> New Religious Movement (NRM)[834], Religious Group[8] -> Christian Traditions[18], Religious Group[8] -> Communal Society[914], Religious Group[8], Religious Group[8] -> Apocalyptic Movements[846]",Joanna Smith,1035,"Waco, Texas","The Branch Davidians lived just northeast of Waco, TX on a compound called the Mount Carmel Center.",United States[366],E,N,NA,1,1,1,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,0,1,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,1,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,0,1,1,1,0,1,0,1,1,1,1,0,1,0,0,1,0,1,0,1,1,1,0,1,1
1.1,984_N,984_N,984,"Non-elite (common people, general populace)",Calvinism (Early/Reformation),Database of religion history (DRH),"Calvinism, in its early stages, drew its character and theological emphases from the ministry and teaching of John Calvin. Born in France, Calvin moved to Geneva in 1534 and, after a brief exile (1538-41), he returned and was installed as the religious leader of the new republic. Calvin was influenced by other early Reformers—Martin Luther, Huylrich Zwingli, Philip Melancthon, and Heinrich Bullinger—and adopted the theological touchstones of the movement: scripture alone, faith alone, grace alone, Christ alone, and glory to God alone. While early Calvinism continued to affirm much of the Christian tradition, Calvin was instrumental in forming his own distinct form of Protestantism. Theologically, early Calvinism distinguished itself from Roman Catholicism in its understanding of the authority of scripture, the person and work of Jesus Christ (Christology), the emphasis on God’s election (predestination), the sacraments, and on the purpose and shape of the Christian life. In terms of the latter, Calvin uniquely combined the ecclesiastical structures of the church in Geneva with the local governing structures, effectively combining his theological commitments about the transformation of the human being by the grace of God in faith with their social and ethical expressions. His understanding of the way the Church could and should regulate the moral lives of citizens, as well as church members, was rooted in an expectation that this was how societies, nations, and eventually the world, would be transformed. While later Calvinism is associated with a number of different ecclesiastical forms and cannot be said to agree on any one set of theological doctrines, early Calvinism was very much tied to the person of John Calvin and the local way he applied his theology, ecclesiastically and politically, in Geneva.

1.1,884_E,884_E,884,Elite,Sub Saharan Africa Pentecostalism,Database of religion history (DRH),"European missionaries brought Christianity to Sub Saharan Africa with the goal of converting the population of the region. They were indeed successful in that the local population took Christianism and made it their own. Hence was born African Independent Churches in the early twentieth century leading later to the Pentecostal movement. After the wave of independences from colonial rule in the 1960s, the independent churches thrived until the 1970s when the Pentecostal movement which was at that point an underground movement became full blown. It is now becoming the dominant form of Christianity in Africa attracting converts from all religions, tribal and ethnic groups, and all walks of life. 
 

 The movement is defined by the day of Pentecost and refers to the encounter with God in the Bible’s book of the Acts of the apostles. Pentecostals believe they receive an impartation of God’s spirit when they confess the name of Jesus. Its main pillars are the concept of being born again, the baptism of the Holy Spirit, speaking in tongue, the divine healing, the eschatological belief of the return of Jesus Christ, and all wrapped in the concept of the full gospel. First, the concept of ‘born again’ refers to a spiritual birth of an individual which in the African context connect the person to the invisible world. Second, the baptism of the Holy Spirit is a Christian concept of spiritual empowerment which is also found in African spiritual belief which gives the person a spiritual awareness and discernment. Third, the divine healing mimics African belief that a person can be supernaturally healed in opposition to modern medicine. Finally, the return of Jesus Christ is similar to African eschatological belief that there is an invisible world out there which controls the visible world.
 

  In fact, African cosmology assumes two worlds: one which is invisible and populated with spirits and the other which is the visible world. The interaction between the invisible and visible worlds determines human’s faith. Pentecostals practice exorcisms where evil spirits are cast out followed with weeping, laughing, and screaming. They engage in what is known as spiritual warfare, praying, and fasting. These beliefs are ingrained in Africans’ psyche and were comfortably found in Pentecostal belief generating what is known as African Pentecostalism. It gives people a sense of self, meaning, and reconcile years of exploitation with the newfound identity. It encourages free enterprise, hard work, and self-determination.","Religious Group[8], Religious Group[8] -> African Religions[9], Religious Group[8] -> African Religions[9] -> Pentacostal[797], Religious Group[8] -> African Religions[9] -> Pentacostal[797] -> African Pentecostalism[990]",Azizou Atte oudeyi,1041,Sub Saharan Africa,This region is the geographic area of Africa that lies below the Saharan Desert.,"Africa[14], Africa[14] -> Eastern Africa[63], Africa[14] -> Western Africa[65], Africa[14] -> Southern Africa[66]",E,NA,NA,1,0,1,0,1,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,1,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,0,1,1,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,1,1,1,0,0,1,1,1,1,0,1,0,0,1,1,1,0,1,1,0,0,1,1
1.1,880_NR,880_NR,880,"Religious Specialists, Non-elite (common people, general populace)",Egyptian Salafism (inluding North Africa and West Asia),Database of religion history (DRH),"Salafis' main aim is to practice Islam as the ""pious predecessors"" (al-salaf al-salih) of Prophet Muhammad practiced it. This means overlooking or even shunning any practice or belief that is deemed an accretion to what the earliest Muslims did or believed. Salafi thought is often linked to the Saudi Arabian thinker Muhammad ibn 'Abd al-Wahhab, but scholarship suggests that the movement has roots in 19th century Islamic Egyptian thought. Traces of Salafi practice and belief can be found worldwide.
 The main sources of Sunni practice and beliefs are the Qur'an, the normative example of the Prophet Muhammad (sunna) and the lifestyle of the early generation of Muslims. 
 The intellectual roots of the movement lie in the thought of the eighteenth-century Arabian thinker Muhammad ibn ‘Abd al-Wahhab (d.1791). A man of little traditional religious training, Ibn ‘Abd al-Wahhab nonetheless sought to rectify what he perceived to be the unlawful accretions to Islam and Islamic practice that he observed in his people in what is today Saudi Arabia. He wanted to eliminate the practice of venerating saints and sought to place tawhid (the belief in Allah’s oneness) at the center of Islamic belief. Any actions that were deemed antithetical to this or were seen as an innovation (bid‘a) were to be condemned and eliminated.  
 But the term Salafism is a tricky one. Scholars like Henri Lauzière explain that there are two usages for the term. Although modernists religious scholars like Jamal al-Din al-Afghani (d. 1897) and Muhammad ‘Abduh (d. 1905) did not actually call themselves Salafi, they are often credited with having spearheaded the movement in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries. These “Modernist Salafis,” as Lauzière calls them, strove to “rearticulate their religion in terms that were more relevant to contemporary realities and more intelligible and appealing to the rational minds of the educated elite.” Like Ibn ‘Abd al-Wahhab, they viewed the immediate followers of Prophet Muhammad (al-salaf al-salih) as the exemplars of pious Islam. They were thus committed to the example of the salaf and to the text but did not believe that this should be a hindrance on their ability to adapt aspects of the law to help the Muslim world (umma) move forward in the ever-changing, modernizing world.  
 “Purist Salafis,” on the other hand, are exclusionary in that they view that theirs is the only form of Islam that could lead to salvation. It is the pure Islam of the salaf, “unsullied by any innovation, deviation or accretion and uncontaminated by exogenous influences” that should be followed by all. Lauzière argues, however, that, in the beginning, Purist Salafism did not completely reject religious compromise. Between the 1920s and the 1950s, leading Salafi activists “modified their understanding of Islamic reform…mainly to accommodate political considerations and to increase the likelihood of achieving political independence from colonial powers.” They thus constructed a rigorist form of Salafism that emphasized purity but sought to unite and gain a following throughout the Muslim world. Post-independence, however, Purist Salafis no longer had to downplay their exclusionary vision of Islam. This form of Salafism “responded to the challenge of modernity by escaping to the secure haven of the text, but it treated rational moral insight as fundamentally corrupting of the purity of the Islamic message,” stunting its growth and ability to respond to modern needs and inquiries. Despite this, it was the purists who continued to thrive, while modernists, having played their part during the colonial period, fell by the wayside.

1.1,935_N,935_N,935,"Non-elite (common people, general populace)",Nigerian Pentecostalism,Database of religion history (DRH),"Pentecostalism has become a major cultural force in Nigeria since the early twentieth century, accounting for approx. 63% of Nigerian Christians today (World Christian Database). The success of Pentecostalism across Nigeria and Africa more widely has resulted in the widespread absorption of Pentecostal styles of worship into 'mainstream' African Protestant and Catholic churches (the latter known as 'Charismatic' churches). Pentecostals emphasise the active presence of the Holy Spirit both in worship settings and beyond, evidenced in miracles, healings, prophecies, tongues (glossolalia) and other 'gifts of the Spirit'. Nigerian Pentecostals tend to regard their religious faith as a means by which to ‘break’ with their ‘pagan’ heritage, and becoming born again as a way to be delivered from indigenous African spiritual and cultural life (Meyer 1998). Some Pentecostal churches place a strong emphasis on tithing and material success (‘Prosperity’), whilst others are more focused on asceticism and purity ('Holiness'), or healing and exorcism (‘Deliverance’).
 Pentecostalism in Nigeria is widely recognised to have unfolded in three phases. The first phase, known as Aladura, or the African Initiated/Independent Church movement, (1910-1930s) was led by Yoruba itinerant preachers like Joseph Ayo Babalola who clashed with missionaries on the use of medicine (Peel 1968). The Aladura movement, meaning ‘praying people’, emphasised prayer, healing and deliverance from traditional 'pagan' religion. In this period, foreign Pentecostal denominations like the Classical Pentecostal church, Assemblies of God, and the Welsh Apostolic church also laid down roots in Nigeria.
 The second wave, known as the 'Latter Rain' revival, took place in the 1950s and was initiated by British and American evangelists like Sydney Granville Elton and Oral Roberts. This phase emphasised deliverance, healing and also apocalyptic eschatology.
 The third wave, known as the Neo-Pentecostal movement, emerged in the 1960s-80s and was heavily influenced by ideas and trends introduced to Nigeria in American evangelical literature. Open air revivals, especially on university campuses such as the Universities of Ibadan and Ife, led to an influx of young converts to the movement. Some denominations emphasised Holiness and millennialism (1970s) whilst others propagated the Prosperity Gospel (80s onward). This period saw the emergence of the Nigerian Pentecostal megachurches like Deeper Life Bible Church and the Church of God Mission International. Moreover, since the 1990s, demonology, spiritual warfare and the practice of Deliverance have become increasingly popular features of Nigerian Pentecostalism.","Religious Group[8] -> Christianity of the global South[1014], Religious Group[8] -> Born Again Christianity[1015], Religious Group[8] -> Evangelical religion[1016], Religious Group[8] -> Aladura[1017], Religious Group[8] -> New Religious Movement[786], Religious Group[8] -> African Religions[9], Religious Group[8] -> Apocalyptic Movements[846], Religious Group[8]",Naomi Richman,1082,Nigeria,"Nigeria, West Africa.

1.1,975_R,975_R,975,Religious Specialists,Neo-Charismatic Movement - Third Wave Charismatic Movement,Database of religion history (DRH),"Pentecostal and Charismatic practices of speaking in tongues through the Baptism of the Holy Spirit had become accepted within many mainline Protestant denominations and the Roman Catholic Church by the 1960s and 1970s. However, many evangelical traditions and churches continued to resist charismatic renewal practices and theologies during the rise of the Second Wave Charismatic Renewal Movement. Charismatics were viewed with suspicion and their practices were critiqued and mocked within evangelical circles.  
 

 Yet, evangelicalism was not immune to change during the 1960s and 1970s. The hippie-led Jesus People Movement took hold in the United States during this time. Young barefoot preachers would encourage their peers to turn away from drugs, accept Jesus Christ as their Lord and Savior, and join a new type of church that emphasized a come-as-you-are vibe with casual dress and provided rock and roll as part of their worship liturgy. In addition, many of the new hippie converts were interested in Charismatic practices of healing and witnessing through signs and wonders. The Jesus People Movement led to the formation of new independent evangelical churches that identified as non-denominational and some of these churches embraced Charismatic theology and practices.
 

 One of the church movements that emerged in the late 1970s was the Vineyard Church in Southern California. The Vineyard was a collection of churches that broke away from Calvary Chapel due to the Vineyard’s desire to emphasize Charismatic practices and theology. On Mother’s Day in 1980, Pastor John Wimber of the Vineyard Christian Fellowship in Orange County, CA and invited a former Calvary Chapel pastor and the face of the Jesus People Movement, Lonnie Frisbee, to preach. Frisbee’s message on healing and the subsequent ministry of healing that took place that morning launched the start of the Vineyard Movement and subsequent Neo-Charismatic movement. This new Neo-Charismatic movement blended evangelical theology with charismatic practices of healing, supernatural prayer languages, and an emphasis on miraculous signs and wonders as a component of evangelism. 
 

 John Wimber began to teach at Fuller Theological Seminary in Pasadena, CA and was influenced by C. Peter Wagner’s research on church growth as well as George Ladd’s Kingdom of God theology. Wimber was able to influence numerous people to start their own independent charismatic churches and ministries as a faculty member and through his conferences that he hosted where he taught on how to minister using supernatural signs and wonder. Wimber developed the concept of “power evangelism” where adherents evangelized using signs and wonders rather than Bible tracts that were popular in the 1960s and 1970s.  
 

 By the 1990s, new independent churches and movements that were evangelical and charismatic were rapidly emerging throughout North America. These included the Toronto Blessing Movement began in 1994 at the Toronto Airport Vineyard Church. Bethel Church in Redding, CA installed Pastor Bill Johnson as their senior pastor in 1996. The International House of Prayer Kansas City was founded in 1999. These Neo-Charismatic churches and others have become popular and controversial for their encouragement of the miraculous, their non-formal style of liturgy, and theological stances on healing, anointing, and supernatural power.
 

 C. Peter Wagner coined the term “Third Wave” charismatic movement to describe these new churches and ministries. Their emphasis on power evangelism, charismatic forms of worship, healing, prayer languages, operating in signs and wonders, and their emphasis on anointing leaders as apostles and prophets made them distinct from traditional Pentecostal churches and Charismatic Renewalists within mainline traditions.","Religious Group[8] -> Evangelical religion[1016], Religious Group[8], Religious Group[8] -> Protestantism[1032]",Nathan Womack,1018,USA,The United States of America,"North America[61], North America[61] -> United States of America[185], United States[366], United States[366] -> Lower 48[400]",NA,NA,R,1,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,0,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,0,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,0,0,1,0,1,0,1,1,0,0,1,0
1.1,892_R,892_R,892,Religious Specialists,Charismatic Renewal Movement in Christianity - Second Wave Pentecostalism,Database of religion history (DRH),"For the first six decades of the 20th Century, Pentecostalism was viewed with skepticism and often outright dismissed by other denominations of Christianity. Many Christians believed Pentecostals to chaotic and disorderly. Pentecostal practices of speaking in tongues, their beliefs in divine healing and prophecy, and their unorganized and noisy prayer gatherings ostracized them from other established Protestant traditions believed to be more orderly and respectable. They were seen as a fringe group that stood outside of the traditions of mainline and evangelical branches of the larger Protestant community.  
 

 However, Pentecostalism and a majority of the Christian communities in the United States would undergo a massive shift as Pentecostal theology and practices burst into the “orderly” worlds of mainline denominations and swept across denominational boundaries beginning in 1960. In a small Episcopalian perish in Van Nuys, CA in April 1960, the charismatic renewal found its genesis when Reverend Dennis Bennett shared his experience of being baptized in the Spirit and speaking in tongues. His announcement angered his congregation and he was asked to resign shortly after sharing his experiences. 
 

 Despite the parishioners of St. Mark’s Episcopal Church being told to not speak about what Reverend Bennett shared about, one parishioner was not going to be quiet. Jean Stone was a parishioner who began a media campaign to chronicle and share about Reverend Bennett’s experience. Stone got Time Magazine and Newsweek to write articles about the renewal movement and Bennett became the defacto face of the Charismatic Renewal movement in the United States. As Bennett’s story spread throughout the country, other clergy from mainline Protestant denominations began to share about their experiences of being baptized in the Holy Spirit. Methodists, Lutherans, Baptists, Presbyterians, Anglicans, Mennonites, Roman Catholics, and others began to open up about their Pentecostal experience and many began to practice speaking in tongues, prophesying, healing, and deliverance.
 

 Although there is an overlap between some of the beliefs between Pentecostals and Charismatics, there are some key differences. Both groups believe in the Baptism of the Holy Spirit, which is an experience that often takes place after conversion (although some adherents experience the Baptism of the Holy Spirit at their conversion). A key difference is the evidence of being baptized in the Holy Spirit. Pentecostals believe that a person must speak in tongues in order to demonstrate that they have been baptized in the Spirit. Charismatics claim that although many people do speak in tongues as their first sign, it is not the only sign that accompanies being baptized in the Holy Spirit. Any manifestations of the gifts of the Holy Spirit outlined in the New Testament are recognized by Charismatics as being baptized in the Spirit.  
 

 The Charismatic Renewal Movement validated Historical Pentecostal churches and movements as part of the American Christian landscape. Prior to the movement, Mainline and Protestant denominations viewed Pentecostalism with disdain and were weary of their theology and practices. However, the media coverage of Reverend Dennis Bennett’s experiences in California in 1960, as well as the rise in denominational clergy sharing about their own experiences of being baptized in the Holy Spirit, led mainline denominational leaders were to address the Charismatic renewal movements taking place in their churches. Most of these denominations ultimately accepted Charismatic adherents as part of their tradition. Other denominations left their position on the charismatic renewal movement open without rejecting the movement outright.","Religious Group[8] -> Christian Traditions[18], Religious Group[8] -> Christian Traditions[18] -> Catholic[153], Religious Group[8] -> Christian Traditions[18] -> Catholic[153] -> 'Roman' Catholic[156], Religious Group[8] -> Christian Traditions[18] -> Pentecostal[180], Religious Group[8] -> Christian Traditions[18] -> Evangelical (charismatic)[784], Religious Group[8] -> Christian Traditions[18] -> Protestantism[826], Religious Group[8]",Nathan Womack,"660, 1018",Global; USA,Region spanning the globe.; The United States of America,"Global[332]; North America[61], North America[61] -> United States of America[185], United States[366], United States[366] -> Lower 48[400]",NA,NA,R,1,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,{01},1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,0,0,1,1,1,1,0,1,0,0,1,0,1,0,1,1,0,0,1,0

However, this commitment generates similar theological reflection and a shared range of social practices. Disagreement about the nature of inclusion persists; this group is distinguished by consistent participation in a conversation about disability inclusion. This entry will highlight how that conversation impacts these organizations' ritual, theology, and other social practices.
 

 Most of this information is based on unpublished ethnographic research conducted by a team led by the Rev. Dr. Erin Raffety of the Center for Theological Inquiry from May - December of 2019, of which I was a part. Our team of 6 researchers worked with 10 organizations in the NJ-NY-PA area who were intentionally welcoming people with disabilities, with the goal of seeing what worked well and what could be done better. We received IRB approval before starting research from New England IRB. All participants signed consent forms showing their awareness of the research. Notes that lack explicit citation are based on this fieldwork, which will be published under the title, From Inclusion to Leadership: Congregational Ministry with People with Disabilities by Eerdmans Publishing in 2021. 
 

 Through fieldwork, it became clear to me and the rest of our research team that one central question for these organizations concerns integrated vs segregated ministry. Ought churches start new programs to specifically welcome people with various disabilities? Or ought they reform their current programs and services such that people with disabilities can access them more effectively? 
 

 Another prominent theme was reflection on the role of the Church in promoting the life and rights of people with disabilities. What ought churches provide and how can churches best support other non-profit organizations and schools that are already welcoming and supporting people with various kinds of disabilities? 
 

 A final theme was the importance of empowering people with disabilities in addition to merely welcoming them. Many churches were eager to discuss different forms this could take, especially with regard to intellectual disability. Some were more reluctant but still open. What does it mean for people with intellectual disabilities in particular to be not just objects of ministry, but subjects? How might churches refine their conceptions of ministry and discipleship in light of this?
 

 In this entry, I use the terms “people with disabilities” and “disabled people” interchangeably to represent some of the range of ways people with disabilities identify, some preferring person-first language and others not.

1.1,842_ENR,842_ENR,842,"Elite, Religious Specialists, Non-elite (common people, general populace)",American Evangelicalism,Database of religion history (DRH),"American Evangelicalism is a subset of American Christianity that spans numerous denominational groups including Baptists, Methodists, Presbyterians, and Pentecostals among others. A theologically diverse movement, American Evangelicals are often recognized for their emphasis on revivalism and personal religious conversion. The movement lacks a centralized institutional leader, but diverse local, regional, and national networks help reinforce religious authority. 
 

 American Evangelical beginnings can be traced back to the early eighteenth century when a series of religious revivals took place in colonial New England. Preachers like Jonathan Edwards and George Whitefield along with lay leaders like Sarah Osborn preached a version of Christianity that prioritized a personal conversion experience in which individuals became assured of their salvation. By privileging an individual experience, evangelical adherents gained the power to proclaim their faith in God giving some scholars the impression that the movement “democratized” Christianity. While individuals may have gained some authority through this emphasis on a personal religious experience, an individual’s community functioned to help evaluate and verify whether experiences were genuine. 
 

 Revivals and worship services that seek to encourage a conversion experience have been hallmarks of the American Evangelical movement. These large events include singing hymns and preaching and could take place either in a church or outside as with the Cane Ridge Reveal of 1801. Individuals like Dwight Moody, Billy Sunday, and Aimee Semple McPherson carried this revivalistic tradition into the twentieth century. Today, large Mega Churches like Saddleback Church in California effectively turn Sunday worship services into large revivalistic events. Not all American Evangelical churches are large, however, and many have no more than a couple hundred members.
 

 American Evangelicals are incredibly effective institution builders, utilizing technological innovation, print culture, higher education, and marketing tactics to attract new members as well as shape and reinforce their identity. From organizations like the American Tract Society to evangelical Colleges and Universities, American Evangelicals have been successful through constructing institutions and accruing wealth as a result of these institutions. 
 

 Coupled with their institution building, American Evangelicals are also politically active. In the nineteenth century this political activism took the form of moral reform societies, and by the twentieth century, evangelical political activism became more intensely wedded to partisan politics. In 1976, the magazine Newsweek declared it the “Year of the Evangelical” spurred in large part to the election of President Jimmy Carter, a self described “Born Again,” evangelical Christian. American Evangelicals continued to exercise significant political influence in American political life well into the twenty-first century, and overwhelmingly supported the election of Donald Trump in 2016.","Religious Group[8], Religious Group[8] -> Christian Traditions[18]",Andrew Gardner,1011,The United States,The United States from the colonial period to the boarders of the 21st century.,United States[366],E,N,R,1,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,1,1,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,1,1,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,1,1,1,1,0,1,0,0,1,0,1,0,1,1,0,0,1,1
1.1,942_NR,942_NR,942,"Religious Specialists, Non-elite (common people, general populace)",African Methodist Episcopal Church,Database of religion history (DRH),"In 1787, roughly a decade after America’s independence from Great Britain and almost a century before Black Americans were guaranteed U.S. citizenship, a group of Black congregants walked out of Philadelphia’s primarily white St. George's Methodist Episcopal Church in the middle of the Sunday service. One of these protesters, Black Methodist minister Richard Allen, eventually founded America’s first independent Black denomination and its oldest formal Black institution—the African Methodist Episcopal Church. Described by W.E.B. Du Bois as the world’s “greatest Negro organization,” the AME Church is a Protestant Christian denomination aligned doctrinally with the United Methodist Church and organized in an Episcopal system. 
 

 To tell the story of the African Methodist Episcopal Church, one must first turn to the history of Methodism, its antecedent. Originated by English minister John Wesley, the transatlantic denomination became ubiquitous in eighteenth and early nineteenth-century America through the revivals of the First and Second Great Awakening. Historians often remark on the egalitarian and democratic nature of these revivals. While it is important for us not to romanticize early Methodism, thereby ignoring Black people's experiences of discrimination and systemic racism within the religious culture and society more broadly, we can still recognize that some enslaved people managed to make a home for themselves within the Methodist fold and, to some extent, were even accepted into communal worship spaces. The fact that services were held in large, open-air fields created a come-one, come-all atmosphere, and ecstatic, embodied worship experiences were customary. It was into this Methodist culture that Richard Allen was converted as a seventeen-year-old enslaved person in 1777. And ten years later, when he led a group of Black Methodists out of St. George's, it was as a consequence of this Methodist culture that he protested. 
 

 While the Methodism to which Allen had been introduced as a young man was more open to Black congregants, the religious culture he experienced at the turn of the eighteenth century was increasingly stratified by race. Although sizable numbers of Blacks had been evangelized by Methodists and even licensed to preach in the mid-1700s, white Methodists started to neglect earlier ideals of acceptance in lieu of pursuing respectability and becoming an established church. Among other practices, white Methodists began to deny Black members leadership roles within the denomination and some white Methodist preachers even refused to hold Black babies during infant baptisms, as historian Julius H. Bailey has shown. Separating from St. George's signified Allen’s rejection of the inequitable treatment of African Americans in Methodist spaces, his recovery of early Methodism’s egalitarian ideals and his articulation of a new religious vision that embraced the humanity of Black Americans. After starting a church of his own in 1794 (Mother Bethel AME), Allen and a collective of other Black Methodists established their own denomination in 1816 with Allen as the organization’s first Bishop. 
 

 Commitments to racial justice and what twentieth-century AME minister and theologian James H. Cone would later name Black liberation theology have served as the cornerstones of the two-hundred-year-old denomination. In the antebellum period, AME churches served as posts for the Underground Railroad. During Reconstruction, Northern AME missionaries travelled southward to teach formerly enslaved people how to read. Today, AME churches provide community programming that, according to their mission statement, aims to “enhance the entire social development of all people.” Furthermore, missionization, particularly in Africa, has been a primary component of the church’s work, leading to the establishment of the denomination in over thirty countries.","Religious Group[8] -> North American Religions[998], Religious Group[8] -> Methodism[971], Religious Group[8] -> American Christianity[1030], Religious Group[8] -> African American Religion[1019], Religious Group[8] -> Protestantism[1032], Religious Group[8] -> Christian Traditions[18], Religious Group[8]",Mélena Laudig,"1088, 1095","North America, South America, Caribbean, South Asia, Africa, Europe; North America, South America, Caribbean, Asia, Africa, Europe","* will return to description; While the denomination originated in the Northern United States, global missions have led to the expansion of the AME Church into over thirty countries.","Asia[1], Europe[3], Africa[14], England[399], North America[61] -> United States of America[185], Latin America and the Caribbean[59], North America[61], Republic of Congo-Brazzaville[454], Nigeria[459], Global[332], Bermuda[462], India[463], Bahamas[464], Liberia[465], Sierra Leone[466], Ghana[467], South America[79], Cote D'Ivoire[469], Togo-Benin[470], Angola[471], Namibia[472], South Africa[473], Haiti[474], Jamaica[475], Dominican Republic[476], Saint Lucia[477], Saint Vincent and the Grenadines[478], Grenada[479], Dominica[480], Martinique[481], Burundi[482], Democratic Republic of the Congo[483], Zambia[484], Kenya[485], Rwanda[486], Suriname[488], Guyana[489], Cuba[490], The Bahamas[491], Canada[492], South Asia[365], United States[366]; Asia[1], Europe[3], Africa[14], England[399], North America[61] -> United States of America[185], Latin America and the Caribbean[59], North America[61], Republic of Congo-Brazzaville[454], Nigeria[459], Global[332], Bermuda[462], South America[79], Bahamas[464], Liberia[465], Sierra Leone[466], Ghana[467], India[463], Cote D'Ivoire[469], Togo-Benin[470], Angola[471], Namibia[472], South Africa[473], Haiti[474], Jamaica[475], Dominican Republic[476], Saint Lucia[477], Saint Vincent and the Grenadines[478], Grenada[479], Dominica[480], Martinique[481], Burundi[482], Democratic Republic of the Congo[483], Zambia[484], Kenya[485], Rwanda[486], Suriname[488], Guyana[489], Cuba[490], The Bahamas[491], Canada[492], South Asia[365], United States[366], Brazil[403], U.S. Virgin Islands[518]",NA,N,R,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,0,1,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,0,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,0,0,1,1,1,0,1,1,0,0,1,1

As such, under Queen Elizabeth, the Church of England established its identity as Reformed and Catholic: 'Reformed' in the sense that it identified its theological authority not primarily in the traditions of the Church but in Scripture, and 'Catholic' in the sense that it retained such Catholic traits as an emphasis upon the apostolic succession of bishops, the sacramental identity of the Church, a formal liturgical character, and the Church's continuity with the Medieval and Patristic past.
 In the modern period (here demarcated as beginning in 1963 with the publication of the significant work of liberal theology 'Honest to God', by the then Bishop of Woolwich John Robinson), the Church of England's identity and sources of authority are contested. Although its sources of doctrine and practice are still formally codified in Canon Law as deriving from Scripture and its historical formularies - the Book of Common Prayer, the 1662 Ordinal, and the Thirty-Nine Articles of Religion - there is wide divergence of opinion as to how this is to be understood.
 The current 'parties' in the Church of England can be divided into three: Evangelical, Catholic and Liberal. Evangelicals emphasize the Reformed heritage of the Church of England and note the authority of Scripture. Catholics stress the importance of the Church's sacraments, its links to the Medieval and Patristic past, and its relationship with other episcopally led churches such as the Roman Catholic Church. Liberals highlight the role of reason in the interpretation of Scripture and the historic formularies. The existence of these different 'traditions' within the Church of England results in a sense of its contested identity: doctrine, belief and practice often vary dramatically from church to church. Its unifying feature must be said therefore to be the institutional structure focussed on the ecclesiastical hierarchy - archbishops, bishops, priests etc. - and the centralized and diocesan adminstrations which oversee parishes and other institutions within the Church.","Religious Group[8], Religious Group[8] -> Abrahamic[905], Religious Group[8] -> Christian Traditions[18]",Jamie Franklin,725,England,"England, mainly Oxford.","Europe[3], Europe[3] -> British Isles[70]",NA,N,R,1,1,1,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,1,1,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,0,1,0,0,1,1,1,0,1,1,0,0,1,1
1.1,894_N,894_N,894,"Non-elite (common people, general populace)",Universal Fellowship of Metropolitan Community Churches,Database of religion history (DRH),"The UFMCC (often shortened to “MCC”) is a Christian denomination that was founded first and foremost as a ministry for LGBTQ people. Reverend Troy Perry, who grew up in rural Florida and worked as a pastor in Baptist and Pentecostal churches before coming out as gay, launched the initial congregation in his Los Angeles living room in 1968. When the denomination was officially established in 1970, there were a handful of congregations, spanning several states. By 1972, there were 35 congregations in 19 states. Today, the MCC consists of over 200 congregations in over 30 countries around the world (although this entry focuses on the U.S. and Canada).
 

 Perry served as Moderator (the denomination’s head) until 2005, and since then there have been three Moderators. Rev. Elder Cecilia Eggleston was elected Moderator in 2019. Every three years, all MCC ministers and selected members gather for General Conference, where the Moderator and the Governing Board (administrative leadership) are elected.
 

 Individual congregations maintain a great deal of autonomy over their worship practices, and thus there is a wide variety of worship styles in the MCC. Many churches blend charismatic and more formal influences. One of the few denomination-wide requirements for worship is that every congregation offer Holy Communion at weekly services.
 

 The theologically diverse denomination defies easy labels of ""conservative"" and “liberal.” For decades, the denomination’s doctrinal statements proudly proclaimed that the MCC “moved in the mainstream of Christianity,” which they defined by the Apostles’ and Nicene creeds. Additionally, these doctrinal statements made what most would deem to be orthodox Protestant affirmations, such as “All men are justified to God through Faith” and “the Bible is the divinely inspired Word of God.” 
 

 In the twenty-first century, however, the denomination's official proclamations of doctrine have become less insistently “orthodox.” Even as the personal theologies of many MCC ministers and members continue to resemble “orthodox Protestant” beliefs, the denomination’s Statement of Faith now includes proclamations like “We don't all believe exactly the same things” and “We are part of an ongoing conversation on matters of belief and faith, shaped by scripture and the historic creeds” (with no attendant declaration of the scripture’s divine inspiration). 
 

 If there is one unifying theological theme across the MCC, from its inception to the present, it is the belief that support for LGBTQ equality is an outgrowth of authentic Christian faith, which is “grounded in God's radically inclusive love for all people” (as the current Statement of Faith puts it). In recent years, what began as the church’s focus on equality for “homosexuals” has expanded, at least in many of the denomination’s circles, to include a focus on social justice issues more broadly.","Religious Group[8], Religious Group[8] -> Christian Traditions[18]",William Stell,1049,U.S. and Canada,"The UFMCC is a global denomination, but more than half of its congregations are in the U.S., spread throughout over 40 states.

The earliest Jesus movement missionary connected with Ephesus is Paul, who is said to have resided in Ephesus in the mid-1st century CE and who provides evidence for an early ""church"" there. In the second century, traditions developed identifying a spot on the nearby Ayasoluk Hill as the burial place of apostle John; there developed a tomb cult that would eventually become an important Christian holy site and pilgrimage destination. By the end of the third century, Ephesus had grown into a central hub of the burgeoning Christian movement, famous for its associations with the apostles Paul and John, presaging its later place among the civic centers of imperial Christianity. 
 Besides Paul’s letters, other early Christian texts connected with Ephesus include the pseudo-Pauline Pastoral Epistles, the Johannine Epistles, the Acts of the Apostles, the Book of Revelation, Ignatius' Letter to the Ephesians, and the apocryphal Acts of John. The latter two sources are our best witnesses to second century Christianity in the area, though the contested provenance of the Acts of John renders its historical utility dubious. Collectively, our sources for early Christianity in Ephesus attest to a substantial, though still marginal, presence of Christian groups in the city in the first three centuries. Almost all of our earliest sources attest to conflict between groups associated with the city, suggesting that Christianity there was comprised of a diverse collection of groups. 
 The partial and highly stylized nature of our earliest sources, however, frustrate attempts to discern reliable sociological information, especially whether and how Ephesian Christians were distinct from other Christian groups, Jews, and Greco-Roman polytheists. Scholars have sometimes suggested that an early Pauline strand of Christianity was ""overtaken"" by a competing Johannine tradition (see DRH entries on ""Pauline"" and ""Johannine"" Christianities for more on these groups), but our sources prevent any kind of clarity on that front. Utilizing material and literary evidence, Katherine Shaner has recently suggested that women and enslaved people played prominent roles in the earliest Christian communities in Ephesus.

Associated with the emergence of Latin American liberation theology, CEBs of the late 1960s began as community formation projects led by missionary nuns and priests in poor communities. Their model and method took inspiration from Paulo Freire’s Pedagogy of the Oppressed (1968), the Second Vatical Council (1962 – 1965), from early Catholic Action programs, and from the social and political critiques that emerged among liberation movements across the region following the Cuban Revolution. Throughout the 1970s, CEBs became increasingly lay-led and developed into a powerful religious and political social movement. As such, while CEBs often formed larger regional or national organizations to facilitate communication and political mobilization, this movement was broadly grassroots, disaggregated, and pluralistic in theology, practice, and sense of purpose. Despite their significant diversity, Latin American CEBs shared common tendencies such as: lay leadership and greater lay participation in liturgical life, small community worship and organization, an emphasis on gender parity, a commitment to grassroots politics, a Marxist and liberation theology-informed social critique, and a spiritual educational model rooted in lay analysis of scripture applied to present, worldly concerns.

Sachchai is rapidly spreading across villages and towns in Nepal. Hundreds of thousands of believers have embraced it. More than ninety percent of the believers are women who mostly are from poor and low-caste backgrounds. Sachchai claims to be an inclusive, egalitarian, and universal group. People from any religious and cultural background are welcome and they do not need to abandon their past religions and cultures. But the believers are required to believe in Jesus and study the Bible. Other synchretist faith-based groups like Sachchai are also found in South Asia. For example, Christ-Bhakta followers in Tamil Nadu, India, who identify themselves as Christ-Bhakta Hindus, and Jesus Imandars in Bangladesh, who identify themselves as Isa-Muslims (Jørgensen 2008; Kuttiyanikkal 2014) .

 Sachchai was established by Christian evangelicals in the late 1970s in India but could not prosper until the first decade of the 21st century when it got fertile ground in Nepal. Extreme political instabilities, huge international labor migration of men, dire lack of public services, and, most importantly, rising domestic violence against women, all have contributed to the rapid expansion of Sachchai.

The major issue leading to the split concerned disagreements over slavery. The Methodist Episcopal Church (MEC) still had many slaveholders after the schism in 1844 saw the creation of the Methodist Episcopal Church, South (MEC, S). Official church policy recognized slaveholding as sin, but in practice had accepted the reality of the practice and attempted to justify it under several theories (e.g., paternalism toward slaves, keeping slaveholders in the church). Roberts and other abolitionists saw this compromise as a violation of the ethical precepts of Christianity and their Wesleyan heritage (John Wesley had was an abolitionist in Britain). However, the direct cause of the formation of the Free Methodist Church was a series of political maneuvers in Roberts’ home conference which saw Roberts and several other pastors expelled from the MEC. There is a split in the scholarship as to whether Robert’s abolitionist views lead to the political maneuvers or was merely one view amongst many that angered important parts of the church’s hierarchy (see Snyder, 406-7).
  Upon establishing the new denomination, Roberts ended the practice of ‘pew renting’ by which wealthy individuals could ‘rent’ a pew in church with better visibility, both for and of themselves. He also ended instrumental music in churches, not on grounds against such music, but against the practice of paying trained musicians out of the church’s funds which could have gone to other needs. Like much of the holiness tradition of the nineteenth century, simplicity was a virtue.
 Currently, the church has less than 100,000 members in the United States but totals more the one million total members worldwide. It is episcopal in organization with three bishops, each based in the USA. The church is connected to five universities in the United States: Roberts Wesleyan in New York, Spring Arbor in Michigan, Greenville University in Illinois, Central Christian University in Kansas, and Seattle Pacific in Washington; and another four internationally. The church is also affiliated with several non-denominational schools, including Azusa Pacific in California, and Asbury University and Asbury Theological Seminary in Kentucky.
 The Free Methodist Church fits nearly all definitions of ‘evangelical’ and members are generally theologically and politically conservative (in the USA) though the latter has more diversity among congregants. Among the other Wesleyan related churches, Free Methodists are most similar in theology to the Church of the Nazarene and the conservative (sometimes called ‘traditional’) wing of the United Methodist Church due to their teachings of both progressive and instantaneous sanctification at some point after justification. This experience has many names from different theologians but most use the terms ‘Entire Sanctification’ or ‘Second work of grace’ to describe it.","Religious Group[8], Religious Group[8] -> Christian Traditions[18], Religious Group[8] -> Christian Traditions[18] -> Methodist[166]",Steven Lane,"1037, 1103",Free Methodist World Conference; Free Methodist World Conference.,Countries with Free Methodist Churches,"Asia[1], Europe[3], Europe[3] -> Eastern Europe[251] -> Romania[259], Middle East[5], Europe[3] -> Eastern Europe[251] -> Ukraine[262], Europe[3] -> Northern Europe[263], Oceania[13], Africa[14], Europe[3] -> Northern Europe[263] -> United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland[280], Europe[3] -> Southern Europe[73] -> Greece[286], Europe[3] -> Southern Europe[73] -> Italy[288], Europe[3] -> Southern Europe[73] -> Portugal[291], Asia[1] -> East Asia[37], Europe[3] -> Southern Europe[73] -> Spain[294], Asia[1] -> South Asia[40], Europe[3] -> Western Europe[296], Europe[3] -> Western Europe[296] -> Belgium[298], Europe[3] -> Western Europe[296] -> France[299], Latin America and the Caribbean[59], North America[61], Africa[14] -> Eastern Africa[63], Africa[14] -> Northern Africa[64], Africa[14] -> Western Africa[65], Africa[14] -> Southern Africa[66], Asia[1] -> Southeast Asia[69], Europe[3] -> Southern Europe[73], Oceania[13] -> Australia[75], South America[79], Africa[14] -> Eastern Africa[63] -> Burundi[85], Africa[14] -> Eastern Africa[63] -> Ethiopia[89], Africa[14] -> Eastern Africa[63] -> Kenya[90], Africa[14] -> Eastern Africa[63] -> Malawi[92], Africa[14] -> Eastern Africa[63] -> Mozambique[95], Africa[14] -> Eastern Africa[63] -> Rwanda[97], Asia[1] -> East Asia[37] -> Taiwan[355], Africa[14] -> Eastern Africa[63] -> Uganda[101], Africa[14] -> Eastern Africa[63] -> United Republic of Tanzania[102], Africa[14] -> Eastern Africa[63] -> Zambia[103], Africa[14] -> Eastern Africa[63] -> Zimbabwe[104], Africa[14] -> Middle Africa[105], Africa[14] -> Middle Africa[105] -> Angola[106], Africa[14] -> Middle Africa[105] -> Cameroon[107], Africa[14] -> Middle Africa[105] -> Congo[110], Africa[14] -> Middle Africa[105] -> Gabon[113], Africa[14] -> Northern Africa[64] -> Egypt[116], Africa[14] -> Southern Africa[66] -> Botswana[122], Africa[14] -> Southern Africa[66] -> Namibia[124], Africa[14] -> Southern Africa[66] -> South Africa[125], Africa[14] -> Southern Africa[66] -> Swaziland[126], Africa[14] -> Western Africa[65] -> Benin[127], Africa[14] -> Western Africa[65] -> Nigeria[381], Africa[14] -> Western Africa[65] -> Ghana[132], Africa[14] -> Western Africa[65] -> Liberia[135], Middle East[5] -> Iraq[392], Africa[14] -> Western Africa[65] -> Togo[142], Latin America and the Caribbean[59] -> Caribbean[143], Latin America and the Caribbean[59] -> Caribbean[143] -> Dominican Republic[155], Latin America and the Caribbean[59] -> Caribbean[143] -> Haiti[158], Latin America and the Caribbean[59] -> Caribbean[143] -> Puerto Rico[162], Latin America and the Caribbean[59] -> Central America[172], Latin America and the Caribbean[59] -> Central America[172] -> Costa Rica[174], Latin America and the Caribbean[59] -> Central America[172] -> Guatemala[176], Latin America and the Caribbean[59] -> Central America[172] -> Honduras[177], Latin America and the Caribbean[59] -> Central America[172] -> Mexico[178], Latin America and the Caribbean[59] -> Central America[172] -> Nicaragua[179], Latin America and the Caribbean[59] -> Central America[172] -> Panama[180], North America[61] -> Canada[182], North America[61] -> United States of America[185], South America[79] -> Argentina[186], South America[79] -> Bolivia (Plurinational State of)[187], South America[79] -> Brazil[188], South America[79] -> Chile[189], South America[79] -> Colombia[190], South America[79] -> Ecuador[191], Middle East[5] -> Jordan[442], South America[79] -> French Guiana[193], South America[79] -> Paraguay[195], South America[79] -> Peru[196], South America[79] -> Uruguay[198], Asia[1] -> East Asia[37] -> China[205], Asia[1] -> East Asia[37] -> Hong Kong Special Administration Region[206], Asia[1] -> East Asia[37] -> Japan[209], Asia[1] -> East Asia[37] -> Republic of Korea[211], Asia[1] -> South Asia[40] -> India[215], Asia[1] -> South Asia[40] -> Nepal[218], Asia[1] -> South Asia[40] -> Sri Lanka[220], Asia[1] -> Southeast Asia[69] -> Cambodia[222], Asia[1] -> Southeast Asia[69] -> Malaysia[225], Asia[1] -> Southeast Asia[69] -> Myanmar[226], Asia[1] -> Southeast Asia[69] -> Philippines[227], Asia[1] -> Southeast Asia[69] -> Thailand[229], Europe[3] -> Eastern Europe[251], Europe[3] -> Eastern Europe[251] -> Bulgaria[253], Europe[3] -> Eastern Europe[251] -> Hungary[255]",NA,N,R,1,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,1,0,0,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,0,1,0,0,1,0,1,0,1,1,1,0,1,0

 The Religious Society of Friends, better known by the once derogatory and later reclaimed moniker “Quakers,” are a historically Christian group. One of many small religious sects to emerge in the wake of the English Civil War, the Quakers formed under the inspiration of the teachings of George Fox, a weaver turned preacher who elevated the “priesthood of the believer” to a hitherto unseen extreme. Fox argued for the abolition of the priesthood (or the laity, as Friends might say), in favor of a Christian community modeled on Fox’s understanding of the early church, one in which all were called to ministry and equally able to communicate with a divine “Light Within.” Fox and the early Friends seem to have been a premillinerian sect who felt Christ’s return was immanent and prepared accordingly, but by the 1670s the Friends had begun to internalize the second coming and institutionalize in earnest. Friends became notorious throughout England for the uniqueness of their theological and social practices—worshipping in silence, eschewing paid ministers and tithes, refusing to use the “pagan” names of months and days, adopting plain clothes and the informal “thou” in place of the honorific “you,” refusing to doff hats for anyone but the Lord, and, most importantly, their refusal to swear oaths in courts of law (after Matthew 5:34) which led to their frequent imprisonment.
 Even after the Friends were granted formal toleration in the Toleration Act of 1689, a number chose to immigrate to the New World, driven by economic and religious motivations. Though Friends began arriving in the Americas as early as 1655, they founded their most influential settlement in Pennsylvania (awarded as a charter to Quaker William Penn in 1681 to repay a lien owed his father), where Friends remained the dominant force in the legislature until 1756, when they resigned en masse rather than dedicate taxes for the French and Indian War, objecting on pacifist grounds. Though never a numerically significant portion of the American population, Friends assumed outsized importance in American religious history by spearheading a variety of social movements: The American abolition movement, women’s suffrage, Native American rights, and pacifist movements all have Quaker origins and inspirations.
 A series of schisms split the American Quakers in the nineteenth century, following the trajectory of many Protestant denominations at the time. The most significant was the 1827 Orthodox-Hicksite split, the Hicksites rallying around the teachings of Elias Hicks, who taught that Jesus became Christ but was not born divine, and that any modern Friend who might follow Jesus’ example in discerning the will of the Inward Light within all. For Hicks, the Bible was valuable as one source among many attesting to God’s previous revelations but was not the unique word of God and should be subordinated to reason and experience. Orthodox Friends, by contrast, affirmed the traditional Christian beliefs that Christ was the sole Son of God who was sent to earth to redeem humanity by dying on the cross. Orthodox Friends increasingly integrated with other Protestant denominations in both theology and practice, while Hicksite Friends grew closer with other progressive denominations active in social movements. The split foreran the two most important Quaker bodies today, the liberal Friends General Conference (FGC) and evangelical Friends United Meeting (FUM). FGC Friends have maintained the distinctively quiet (“unprogrammed”) style of Quaker worship but are arguably post-Christian, while FUM meetings are effectively Protestant. The two groups share little with one another except competing claims to a shared spiritual lineage and the Quaker name itself. 
 The Quakers were not historically known for missions after their initial proselytization efforts in the seventeenth century, but a series of successful international missions initiated in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries have led to large Quaker communities in Kenya, Burundi, Guatemala, and Bolivia. These international meetings are typically, though not invariably, affiliated with either the Evangelical Friends or the Friends United Meeting, and so more closely resemble other Protestant Christian churches than the more liberal FGC Friends. Over a third of the world’s Quakers live in Kenya, the likely provenance of the next stage of Quaker history.","Religious Group[8] -> Christian Traditions[18], Religious Group[8] -> Liberal Religion[1028], Religious Group[8] -> Post-Christian[1029], Religious Group[8] -> American Christianity[1030], Religious Group[8]",Andrew Taylor,"1098, 1125",Religious Society of Friends (Quakers); The Religious Society of Friends (Quakers),"The three largest Quaker countries.; The Quakers were founded in England but reached the height of their social and political influence in America.

It is often associated with Marcion of Pontus, a second-century Christian preacher that came to Rome around 144 CE. Marcion is best remembered for his belief that Jesus was the Savior, but was sent by a God other than the one known to readers of Jewish Scripture. Instead of representing the God of Israel, Marcion believed that Jesus’s God was not the God that created the universe, but was a deity that was not known among humans until Jesus’s arrival.
 

 Marcion is best known for his compilation of Christian texts. Marcion read the Gospel of Luke and ten of Paul’s letters, and some scholars have suggested that Marcion’s use of these eleven texts constituted one of our earliest Christian canons. Paul, as apostle to the Gentiles, was understood by Marcion to be one of the few early Christians who understood that Jesus preached a different God than the God of Israel. However, it is unclear of Marcion himself initiated the collection of Paul’s letters that he used, or utilized a collection already in use. The same goes for Marcion’s use of the Gospel of Luke. Some heresiologists argued that Marcion mutilated the Gospel text by removing particular scenes, such as the birth narrative of Jesus. However, it seems likely that Marcion used a version of Luke’s gospel already in circulation.
 

 Early heresiologists like Justin, Tertullian, and Epiphanius preserve much of our information about Marcion and Marcionite Christians. However, their work is tinged with polemic and likely does not represent Marcion’s own thought, but rather what other Christians feared about Marcionite treatments of God, Christ, and scripture. They accuse Marcion of extreme asceticism and for treating Jesus as a human upon whom Christ descended, as well as that he divorces Jesus’s teaching from any continuity with Jewish scriptures.","Religious Group[8] -> Medieval Christianity[984], Religious Group[8] -> Asia Minor[981], Religious Group[8] -> Syro-Palestinian Religion[930], Religious Group[8] -> Christian Traditions[18], Religious Group[8] -> Early Christianity[774], Religious Group[8]",Chance Bonar,1080,Mediterranean and Mesopotamia,The greatest extent of known Marcionite practitioners from the 2nd-10th centuries CE.,"Europe[3], Middle East[5], Europe[3] -> Western Europe[296], Gaul[431], Carthage[433], Asia Minor[434], Europe[3] -> Western Europe[296] -> Italy[373], Syria[406], Europe[3] -> Western Europe[296] -> Italy[373] -> Rome[374], Eastern Mediterranean[447]",NA,N,R,1,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,1,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,0,1,0,0,1,1,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,1,0,1,1,0,0,1,1

They are generally understood to be Christians who were influenced by the teachings of Valentinus, a second-century teacher and preacher in Rome. Valentinian Christians are best-known for their treatment of God as totally unknowable before Jesus's appearance, their conception of God as a collective entity of Aeons or emanations of the divine, and their belief in a heavenly counterpart that one needed to reunite with.
 

 Our sources for Valentinian thought are split between their own writings and those of their opponents. Until the 20th century, most of our knowledge of the Valentinians came from heresiologists like Irenaeus of Lyons and Tertullian of Carthage, who wrote tractates that stereotyped and condemned their theologies and practices. We also had a few fragments of Valentinus’s own writings and a letter from the Valentinian Ptolemy to Flora embedded in other patristic texts. With the discovery of the Nag Hammadi Codices in the 1940s, we gained access to a broad array of Valentinian texts. These texts gave us a better understanding of Valentinian liturgical practices, exegetical concerns, and cosmological narratives. 
 

 Valentinians have been condemned as heretics since the late second century. However, Valentinus himself was never formally condemned during his lifetime, nor was there any mechanism by which to expel him from the Roman churches in the second century. Valentinians often accused of looking “too much” like other types of Christians and attending the same services, which made them a threat to some Christians who feared that they were duplicitous.
 

 Valentinians writings and theological explorations have often been depicted as having two substantial trajectories, known as the Eastern and Western schools. However, recent scholarship has questioned a clear divide between the two schools. Likewise, scholars have recently questioned how “Valentinian” Valentinus himself was, since the cosmological and theological concerns of second- and third-century Valentinian writers often turn in very different directions than the fragments of Valentinus that have been preserved. 
 

 Perhaps one of the most interesting aspects of Valentinian thought if their conception of God as androgynous, and that the various emanations of God exist in male-female dyads. This conception of God’s completeness as based on twoness is also expressed in Valentinian descriptions of union with the divine, in which one joins with their accompanying angel in the ritual of the “bridal chamber” in order to achieve redemption.","Religious Group[8] -> Christian Traditions[18], Religious Group[8] -> Christian Traditions[18] -> Early Christianity[742], Religious Group[8] -> Early Christianity[774], Religious Group[8], Religious Group[8] -> Heresy[854]",Chance Bonar,6,Ancient Mediterranean,"Ancient Mediterranean tagged with ""Western Europe"" out of convention, but actually overlaps with a few regions.","Europe[3], Europe[3] -> Western Europe[296]",NA,N,R,1,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,1,1,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,1,1,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,1,0,1,1,1,0,1,1
1.1,988_N,988_N,988,"Non-elite (common people, general populace)",Churches of Christ- United States,Database of religion history (DRH),"Churches of Christ in North America are a collection of autonomous Christian congregations that have their origins in the ""Restoration Movement"" within American Christianity that occurred in the 1800's. Located primarily in the American south, Churches of Christ emerged in the first major division of the Stone-Campbell Movement at the end of the nineteenth century. This separation was made complete in 1906, when the United States Bureau of the Census distinguished Churches of Christ as a separate and distinct religious group. There are currently more than 13,000 individual congregations within the United States with an average membership of 100 people. Of those 13,000 congregations, 1,240 of them have a predominately African American membership (approximately 172,000 members). Churches of Christ also has an additional 240 congregations that are independent Spanish-speaking churches, most of which are located in Texas, California, and Puerto Rico.
 

 The majority of members of Churches of Christ in the United States live in the central and southern regions of the country. While there are Church of Christ congregations in every state, they are most heavily concentrated in the American south, from Texas to North Carolina. More than 28 percent of members of Churches of Christ live in either Texas or Tennessee. Churches of Christ began from a motivation not to start a new form of Christianity, but to serve as a unifying movement that sought to bring together previously divided Christians through an appeal to the pattern of Christianity as interpreted in the New Testament. 
 

 Following from this appeal to a return to the form of Christianity present within the New Testament, Churches of Christ have rejected any formal organizational structures, choosing instead to have the local congregation serve as its own governing authority. This has also meant that Churches of Christ have no official journals or other processes by which to declare sanctioned positions. Because of the independent nature of Churches of Christ, commonalities across the tradition depend more on a specific set of practices and interpretive strategies than declared theological convictions or beliefs.
 

 While changing within some parts of the tradition, Churches of Christ is most well-known for its practice of acapella singing. Yet there are other distinctive features that have marked this denomination as a distinctive group among other Christian traditions. First among these distinctive features is the hermeneutical approach that has been at the core of Church of Christ identity and practice since its inception. This interpretive approach rests on a three-fold pattern that reads Scripture and shapes its communal and individual practice by finding in Scripture a direct command, an example to imitate, or by making a necessary inference when commands or examples are not present. This interpretive approach has been highly influential within Churches of Christ, and is the source of many contemporary debates and the appropriate response. Second, Churches of Christ are defined by a strong commitment to notions of the priesthood of all believers, and therefore eschew any distinction between a “religious” and “non-religious” class. There is no ordination process within Churches of Christ. And while religious training (either through a theological school or some other form) is viewed as a positive thing, none is required to serve in a ministerial role within the tradition. Rather, worship and communal life within Churches of Christ is dependent upon a high level of involvement by the members of each congregation. Finally, Churches of Christ have, historically, possessed a high level of exclusivism in its understanding of its religious identity. While this characteristic has come under fire and is changing within many parts of the tradition, it has been a defining feature for much of the tradition’s history.
 

 As it moves into the 21st century, Churches of Christ are currently facing a number of questions and challenges, ranging from questions of gender and sexuality inclusion, to the trends of religious decline that are effecting all religious traditions within the United States.","Religious Group[8], Religious Group[8] -> Christian Traditions[18], Religious Group[8] -> Christian Traditions[18] -> Stone-Campbell (Restoration Movement)[182], Religious Group[8] -> American Christianity[1030]",Mason Lee,1146,Churches of Christ in the United States,Churches of Christ in 2020,"North America[61], North America[61] -> United States of America[185], United States[366], United States[366] -> Texas[538], United States[366] -> Tennessee[537]",NA,N,NA,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,0,1,1,0,0,0,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0
1.1,857_R,857_R,857,Religious Specialists,Wesleyanism,Database of religion history (DRH),"The Methodist/Wesleyan denomination can be said to have commenced in 1738 When John Wesley, an Anglican pastor, had an experience of the Holy Spirit on the road to Aldersgate in the outskirts of London. He wrote in his Journal, following the teachings of Martin Luther on righteousness that, “I felt my heart strangely warmed. I felt I did trust in Christ, Christ alone, for salvation; and an assurance was given me that He had taken away my sins, even mine, and saved me from the law of sin and death.” One of the distinctive features of Methodism/Wesleyanism is what has become referred to as its “quadrilateral;,” the four sources of ecclesiastical authority. These consist of scripture, tradition, experience, and reason. This supplements the Anglican threefold sources, which consist of scripture, tradition, and reason.
 To the traditional Reformation doctrines of salvation by faith alone (sola fide) and justification by faith, and antinomianism, John Wesley added certain maxims that distinguished his movement from the larger Reformation tradition. Acutely among them was his notion of perfection in love in the earthly life. This notion is rooted in 1 John:1 12, 17, Hebrews 12:1f., and Matthew 5:48. Christians are to be perfect as their heavenly father is, especially in love. Additionally, Wesley emphasized a doctrine known as “Arminianism” (named for the Dutch theologian Jacobus Arminius), a rebuke to the Calvinist notion of predestination. Additionally, he stressed the “means of grace” that include of piety, mercy, as well as social and communal practices. With Calvin, Wesley emphasized the “real presence” of Christ in the Eucharistic elements; against Calvin he prescribed an open Communion—even the unbaptized are welcome at the Table of the Lord (he referred to Communion as a potential “converting ordinance.” Another chief ordinance is Holy Baptism, performed either in childhood or in adulthood. The United Methodist Book of Worship contends, “The Baptismal Covenant is God's word to us, proclaiming our adoption by grace, and our word to God, promising our response of faith and love.” Wesley also borrowed the concepts of prevenient grace, original righteousness, and sanctification from other Christian traditions.
 Wesley’s closest associates were his brother Charles (primarily known for his proficient hymnody) and George Whitefield (himself a Calvinist who believed in predestination), as well as his mother, Susannah who was his foremost spiritual consort. Methodism/Wesleyanism gave birth to the Holiness Movement, which in turn gave birth to Pentecostalism. The Church of Jesus Christ, Latter Day Saints, was formed by a former Methodist. Methodist/Wesleyan denominations today include the United Methodist Church (primarily in the United States but with a large following in sub-Saharan Africa), the Church of the Nazarene, the British Methodists, the African Methodist Episcopal Church, the African Methodist Episcopal Church, Zion, and merged, united denominations in Canada, Zambia, and Australia. Most denominations have an episcopal, connexional polity – a bishop presides over larger collections of congregations, a superintendent over more local collections, and an ordained elder over individual (or multiple) local churches.

It combined moral and theological elements of Protestant Christianity (especially Quakerism) with Iroquois rituals and cosmology. The founder of the movement, Handsome Lake (1735-1815), was from the Seneca tribe--one of the six great nations of the Iroquois Confederacy (1722-1867). The movement, popularly referred to as ""Longhouse Religion,"" remains active today.
 

 In 1799 Handsome Lake, brother to the Seneca war chief Cornplanter, experienced a vision while in a fevered state. This vision marked the beginning of the Gaiwiio religion. While laying bedbound, Handsome Lake pondered the misfortune of his tribe. The Seneca, once a proud Iroquois Nation, had become a broken people during the burgeoning expansion of a young America. Poverty and alcoholism, in particular, had laid waste to his people. As he drifted into sleep, he was visited by three spirits, which made him well again and, additionally, bestowed upon him a message from the Great Creator and commanded him to spread the instruction among his people. 
 

 The Next day, at the Strawberry Festival, a healthy Handsome Lake conveyed this divinely delivered message to all who had attended. The message primarily contained instructions from the Creator on how to order society on earth. It preached against four ""words"" or evils which the people were to avoid: whiskey, witchcraft, love-magic, and abortion or sterility. Those guilty of these acts must repent to Handsome Lake, or, if the transgression was severe enough, to the Creator. From accounts taken by Quakers at the Strawberry festival, we know that this message was well received and that one could ""feel the weight of the Spirit"" and ""the love of God"" present and flowing among the audience (Wallace 1969, 242). 
 

 In the years to come (1799-1801), Handsome Lake would have new visions sent to him by spirits sent on behalf of the Creator. The second essential vision set out an apocalyptic theology for the followers of Handsome Lake. In it, he saw the death of the earth and the eternal fate of the wicked and the good. The sinful suffered at the hands of the Tormentor (or Punisher), while the righteous reunited with the Great Spirit in the Heaven World. A third vision instructed Handsome Lake to spread his Gospel to all Indians. Thus at the end of these three visions, Gaiwiio had its essential form. It was concerned with living righteously on earth for the sake of eternity, fascinated with the inevitable destruction of the planet, and aimed to convert as many Indians as possible to its ranks.","Religious Group[8], Religious Group[8] -> New Religious Movement[786], Religious Group[8] -> Native American (North American) Religions[38]",James Waters,1016,Seneca Reservations (1797),This area covers all Seneca Reservations as of 1797.

They are the descendants of the group of Zoroastrians who migrated to India after the Islamic conquest of Iran in the 7th century CE. The Parsis of India constitute the largest community of followers of Zoroastrianism in the world. Over the centuries, the Parsis have integrated into Indian society, while simultaneously maintaining their distinct religious customs and ethnic identity. The term Pārsi (meaning ‘Persian’ in the Persian language) is used as a descriptor of the community signifying their Iranian origin.
 The early history of the Parsis in India is not known well, and mainly traced to a single source, the Qisse-ye Sanjān ‘The Story of Sanjān’ dated to 1600 CE. After initially settling in and around the town of Sanjān in South Gujarat on the west coast of India, they are supposed to have dispersed northwards to other towns in Gujarat, mainly Navsari, Ankleshwar, Bharuch and Khambat (Cambay).
 However the period from the 17th century onward is relatively well recorded, and after the arrival of the British in India, the Parsis transformed from a predominantly rural agricultural community to one engaged in many services and industrial pursuits, especially in the cities of Surat and Bombay. The 18th and 19th centuries saw the community rapidly rising to prominence, and under British patronage, were pioneers in many fields including education and the arts. Many prominent families amassed large fortunes and the community became well-known for its munificent charities. In the 20th century, the Parsis dispersed across the Indian sub-continent as well as to other British colonies such as Aden and East African countries.
 The Parsis today are a highly urbanised community with more than 95% of its members living in cities, chiefly Mumbai (formerly Bombay) which has been home to 70% of the Indian Parsis since the 1950s. The last fifty years have seen many Parsis, especially the youth, emigrating to other countries, mainly UK, USA and Canada, the Middle-east and more recently to Australia and New Zealand.  
 

 Class: Among the Parsis, the priestly class (Athornans) is differentiated from the laity (Behdins), and the priesthood is hereditary. Only boys belonging to the priestly class are eligible to undergo the initiation ceremonies of priesthood. 
 Language: Since the Parsis were based in the Indian state of Gujarat for much of their long history, their native language is Gujarati; however their dialect, Parsi Gujarati, is distinct from the standard Gujarati of the state. While almost all Parsis can converse in Gujarati, the youth especially in urban areas increasingly use English as their primary language for communication. The religious texts of the Parsis are mainly in Avestan, an Old Iranian language, and also in Pahlavi (Middle Persian). Though both these languages are not comprehended by a majority of the Parsis, all prayers are still recited in these languages as per tradition by both the priesthood and the laity.
 Sects: The Parsis are differentiated from their fellow Zoroastrians who arrived from Iran to India in the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries and are known as the Iranis. The term Parsi-Irani is used as a designator for the entire Zoroastrian community of India, however the standalone term Parsis is also used interchangeably as an all-encompassing term. 
 The community is also divided on the basis of a calendrical difference into two factions, the majority Shahenshahis (‘Royalists’) who continued to follow the existing calendar of the Indian Zoroastrians, and the minority Kadimis (‘Ancients’) who adopted the old calendar of the Iranian Zoroastrians, which runs one month ahead of the Shahenshahi calendar.","Religious Group[8], Religious Group[8] -> Zoroastrianism[49], Religious Group[8] -> Zoroastrianism[49] -> Parsis (India)[295]",Kerman Daruwalla,1145,Traditional centers of the Parsis,"The main region of concentration of the Parsi population.

Kang, whose religious name is Yeongsindang, was born in 1890 in North Jeolla province. After years of spiritual practice which was also accompanied by his wife and son, Yeongsindang attained a form of spiritual awakening, or enlightment, after which he began to display supernatural and prophetic abilities, and gain disciples. The object of faith in Gaengjeongyudo is an astrological diagram called Seondanggung, which is composed of elements such as the East and the West, the Yin and the Yang, and 24 seasons and periods. At the core of Gaengjeongyudo’s tenets is the notion that the three traditions of Confucianism, Buddhism, and ‘Seon’ (native Korean belief of spirituality and heaven) should be harmonised. It is believed that we are currently living through a time of great change in the universal order, and the questions and answers concerning the future vision are contained in detail in Bueunggyeong, the core scripture written by the founder himself. Followers of Gaengjeongyudo are best known for their traditionalist way of living, and although the membership has significantly declined over the years, many of the followers still reside in Cheonghakdong, maintaining their distinctive lifestyle. Although Gaengjeongyudo is often categorised as a Confucianism-based new religious movement due to the name and distinct traditionalist outlook, such classification is highly disputable. While elements of Confucianism can be found especially from the adherence to Confucian virtues such as loyalty and filial piety, incorporation of Confucian elements in varying extent is in fact a very common characteristic to most native Korean new religions of syncretic nature. Based on the unique scriptures, religious symbols and distinct objects of faith, Gaengjeongyudo is distinguished from Confucianism-based movements such as Daedonggyo and Gonggyo, which placed great emphasis on classical Confucian texts and philosophy.","Religious Group[8] -> Korean Religions[28] -> Korean New Religion[801], Religious Group[8] -> New Religious Movement[786], Religious Group[8] -> Korean Religions[28] -> Korean Confucianism[356], Religious Group[8], Religious Group[8] -> Korean Religions[28]",Yeonju Lee,717,South Korea,"South Korea

1.1,977_ENR,977_ENR,977,"Elite, Religious Specialists, Non-elite (common people, general populace)",Chishti Sufis,Own research (PhD) and secondary literature,"The Chishtis are a Sufi order of immense influence in South Asia, founded in Chisht, Afghanistan, in the tenth century and brought to South Asia in the late twelfth century AD. It is considered the oldest of the Sufi orders operating in the region, and has enjoyed patronage from rulers and politicians throughout its history. Divided into sub-branches, the Chishti order is still influential today. 
 

 The order quickly spread across South Asia even before Delhi’s political ascendancy, with early lodges (khanqahs) acting as sites of influence in Bengal, Gujarat, Malwa and the Deccan. Scholars have noted that such expansion indicates how the order was able to assimilate to social life in these areas; it is likely that for early adherents, Islam was synonymous with the teachings of the local Chishti shaykhs. This focus on adapting to local conditions has also been cited as a reason for their historically close relationship to local rulers and nobility. 
 

 In the eighteenth century, the majority-Muslim qasbah towns of the Upper Doab emerged as sites of Chishti influence.
 

 In Chishti sacred geography, the city of Delhi is especially significant. The shrine of Shaykh Nizamuddin Auliya (d. 1325) is an important site of pilgrimage: each year, the six-day urs ceremony held on the anniversary of Nizamuddin Auliya’s death attracts 150,000 people from across the country. Rulers based in Delhi helped to consolidate the shrine’s importance. Another important pilgrimage site is in Ajmer, Rajasthan, the burial place of Moinuddin Chishti (d. 1236). Emperor Akbar relocated the Mughal capital to the village of Fatehpur Sikri to be next to the site of shaykh Salim Chishti’s (d. 1572) khanqah. 
 

 Though the shrines were always popular, membership in the Chishti order was associated with elites in Mughal times. From the late seventeenth century on, initiation into multiple Sufi orders became more common among prominent Muslim intellectuals, and many Muslim reformers of the nineteenth and twentieth centuries belonged to several orders. While pilgrimage and participation in festivals at shrines is widespread among South Asian Muslims (and some Hindus), formal membership in the order is now largely hereditary, as each Chishti shrine is maintained by a familial lineage of ‘sajjada nasheen’ or spiritual heads of the shrine, who wield power and influence as beneficiaries of donations made to the shrine and managers of its calendar of festivals.
 

 Within the landscape of South Asian Sufi groups, the Chishtis are predominant. They are known for the importance of music in their religious gatherings: Chishtis are credited with the invention of qawwali music, a South Asian devotional genre which is sung on Thursday nights at many shrines and during the annual ‘urs’ festivals which commemorate the saint’s union with God upon their death. The Chishti order has historically been associated with what has been called a ‘syncretic’ culture in South Asia, merging elements from Hindu society in their devotional practices, for example in the rituals surrounding the tomb of the shaykh. 
 

 The order defines itself based on a chain of authority (Silsila, meaning dynasty or literally ‘chain’) that links its spiritual leaders (shaykhs) to each other all the way back to the Prophet. Consequently, there are several sub-sects established at breaking points in this list of shaykhs, called a ‘shajra’, though these are not theologically distinct. In South Asia, the two main branches are the Chishti-Sabri (after ‘Alā-ud-dīn ‘Alī Sābir, d. c. 1291) and the Chishti-Nizami (named for Nizamuddin Auliya, d. 1325).","Religious Group[8] -> Sufi[997], Religious Group[8], Religious Group[8] -> Islamic Traditions[24], Religious Group[8] -> South Asian Religion[1037], Religious Group[8] -> Indic Religious Traditions[510]",Hallie Swanson,1127,Chishti Order,This map includes places which have seen Chishti shrines in the order's long history.

1.1,855_ENR,855_ENR,855,"Elite, Religious Specialists, Non-elite (common people, general populace)",Middle-Class Migrant Muslims in the UAE,Database of religion history (DRH),"The UAE is home to millions of Muslims who exhibit a range of beliefs and practices that reflect the diverse ethnic composition of the country's population. These Muslims are both impacted by local customs and laws governing religion and connected to other places in the world that influence their practice and experiences of religious belonging. In this entry, I provide a general introduction to how religion figures into the lives of middle-class migrant Muslims in the UAE. 
 

 Rather than focus on Emirati citizens, I look at noncitizen residents who have made the UAE their home. This entry is not focused on the working classes of the UAE, employed in sectors like construction or domestic work, nor the ultra-rich, but on migrant Muslims who fall in between the ends of such a spectrum— the people who constitute the UAE’s teachers, doctors, engineers, and business men and women. These men and women are literate, which gives them greater direct access to religious knowledge, and they are educated professionals, which holds implications for their taste and interests in Islam.
 

 While these middle-class migrant Muslims can be mapped across many theological categories, those considered in this entry would generally be categorized as Sunni Muslim. Despite that, their beliefs and practices extend from Salafi inclined, literalist readings of the Quran, hadith, and Islamic tradition to Sufi oriented practitioners who privilege the interior over the exterior.
 What characterizes this religious group is their existence and practice of Islam in a state that is not their own. 
 

 Though their religious practice is governed by the UAE, these migrant Muslims do not have a more permanent claim to a long-term presence there. Moreover, they have connections to other places around the world—other religious scholars, sources of authority, and communities—that play a role in their experience of Islam. It is the process of navigating such different pulls that makes this group unique.
 

 As middle-class migrant Muslims, they also have the literary abilities, language skills, technologies, time, and freedom which permits them to access religious knowledge quite independently—by turning directly to scholars online, published books, or attending Islamic classes in one or multiple languages. This capacity to engage an array of Islamic knowledge introduces them to a range of beliefs and practices in the UAE that they likely would not have had access to in their countries of origin. Such particularities hold implications for how they proceed to embrace their faith.","Religious Group[8] -> Islamic Traditions[24] -> Transnational Islam[968], Religious Group[8], Religious Group[8] -> Islamic Traditions[24], Religious Group[8] -> Islamic Traditions[24] -> Sunni[284]",Joud Alkorani,1021,United Arab Emirates,"The United Arab Emirates, which should be understood as a transnational space home to people hailing from hundreds of ethnic backgrounds connected to the world beyond in a myriad of ways.","Middle East[5], Arabian Gulf[428], United Arab Emirates[429]",E,N,R,1,1,1,0,0,0,1,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,0,0,0,1,1,0,1,0,1,0,1,1,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,0,1,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,1

1.1,958_ER,958_ER,958,"Elite, Religious Specialists",Society of Jesus,Database of religion history (DRH),"Revered and reviled. Saints or devils incarnate. These and other stark dichotomies have dogged the Jesuits throughout their nearly five-century history. That history was born with a second birth; that is, the conversion of a Basque nobleman after the battle of Pamplona in 1521. A cannonball struck the knees of Iñigo Lopez shattering them and his hopes for a career as a courtier. Yet, instead of crippling him, the injuries he sustained transported him into a whole new life, the life of the spirit. His meandering path in the life of religion brought him to unexpected places from Montserrat, to Jerusalem, to Barcelona, to Paris and ultimately to Rome; and to a surprising destiny: the founder and first Superior General of a religious order, the Society of Jesus.
 Paul III officially approved of the Society on September 27, 1540 and in so doing ratified their first formula and institute in which the Jesuits laid out the plan for their common life. In that document the Jesuits commit themselves to a wide variety of ministries of the word including giving the Spiritual Exercises, striving for the progress of souls, partaking in works of charity, educating children and the illiterate. In addition to these pursuits, the Jesuits took a special fourth vow, beyond the three traditional evangelical vows of poverty, chastity, and obedience, of obedience to the pope to undertake missions anywhere in the world. It was in these latter two capacities that the Jesuits became most famous. 
 As the Society rapidly grew from ten to one thousand from 1540 to 1556 so too did its commitment to education. While they were involved in some form of teaching from the outset, their first formal foray into schooling for primarily lay students began in 1548 with the foundation of their school at Messina, Sicily. After that date, schools quickly sprang up in nearly every city where there were Jesuits, and practically every place that did not have a Jesuit school wanted one. Devoted to a rigorous humanist education in the classics, grammar, rhetoric, and other burgeoning arts such as history, while maintaining their instruction in faith and good morals the Jesuits became the teachers par excellence of the early modern period. Indeed, students of the caliber of Moliere, Voltaire, Descartes, and many other attended their schools, which helped earn them their reputation for educational excellence. Even contemporaries, such as Francis Bacon, commended the Jesuit efforts in education in his own writings on education reform.  
 Their schools were not limited to the confines of Europe. In fact, schooling was a major part of their missionary endeavors where they taught both Europeans and indigenous populations alike. The Jesuits were adept missionaries, with a unique style of accommodation. Their educational background in languages encouraged them to learn the languages of indigenous populations and prepare grammar books for those languages in an effort to teach others. Jesuits explored and frequently wrote about the new cultures they interacted with as well as the new environments, flora, and fauna they encountered. As a result, they published many ethnographies, but also letters that they sent on an annual basis to Rome, known as the Jesuit Relations. These letters electrified European audiences thirsting for knowledge of faraway lands and inspired many young men to become Jesuits. 
 Outside of these two ventures the Jesuits also excelled in preaching, the study of theology, and even as patrons of the arts. They produced some of the greatest theologians of the time including Francisco Suarez and Robert Bellarmine. Similarly, they had relationships with the greatest artists of the day such as Michelangelo, Bernini, and even numbered the great painter and art theorist Andrea Pozzo among their own.
 Still, wherever the Jesuits succeeded they also seemed to draw harsh criticism. This was especially true in their missionary endeavors where detractors accused them of using the mission fields for the purpose of acquiring land and riches. Similarly, as theologians, many of their ideas became controversial. Dominicans and later Jansenists (including Pascal) accused them of neo-Pelagianism on account of their insistence on the role of free will in salvation. 
 These criticisms, added to various political intrigues, fueled the flames that eventually led to the general suppression of the Society of Jesus in 1773. Over the two hundred and thirty three year history of the “Old Society” the Jesuits achieved many major accomplishments and earned the ire of many detractors. To some they were saints to others devils incarnate. They were reviled as much as revered.","Religious Group[8], Religious Group[8] -> Roman Catholic[996]",Thomas SantaMaria,498,Italy,"Italy south of the Alps, including Sicily, Sardegna, and Corsica","Europe[3], Europe[3] -> Southern Europe[73]",E,NA,R,1,0,1,0,0,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,0,1,1,0,0,0,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,1,0,1,0,1,1,1,0,1,1

Against the mainstream, Donatists argued that the lapsed could never re-enter the Church.
 

 A contested episcopal election of 311, in which the Donatists and the Catholics each elected their own bishop, led to the Donatists appealing to Constantine in 313 to determine the rightful bishop. Constantine sided against the Donatists. From 317-321, he ordered their suppression using measures akin to those of the persecuting emperors: confiscating property, exile, and death. A brief but violent revival of the persecution occurred in 347-348 under his son, Constans.

 Augustine of Hippo often wrote against them, and the Council of Carthage in 411 also condemned them. Nevertheless, Donatists made up the majority of North African Christians from the fourth to fifth centuries.

1.1,921_N,921_N,921,"Non-elite (common people, general populace)",Bhils,Database of religion history (DRH),"Bhils are a part of a geospatially dispersed tribal community of Western India. They are grouped under the constitutional category of Scheduled Tribes. While Bhili is the main language for the community, Bhils are known to be conversant with a variety of other vernacular languages depending on the region they reside in. Bhils have a rich tradition of orally transmitted religious literature which shares similarities with classical Hindu mythology and yet it is distinct in its own vernacular way. Bhils pay reverence to most popular Hindu gods, rituals, and customs; however, most of the gods and associated practices have hybrid histories with classical myths and practices fluidly blending in with vernacular variants.  
 

 

 The term Bhil is thought to be derived from the word, Vill, which means bow in Telugu and Kannada. This is keeping in line with their reputation as skilled archers and hunters. Historically, powerful Bhil kings are thought to have established their own kingdoms in what is present day Gujarat and Rajasthan. It was only through displacement by Rajput and Chalukya rulers of that time that Bhils were made to retreat into forests and hilly regions. Bhils are mentioned in historical records such as Ain-i-Akbari and ancient folk legends such as Kathasaritasagar. Mention of Bhils becomes clearer in the medieval period where their association with Marathas in their fight against the Mughals is well documented. Their knowledge of hilly and jungle terrains made them valuable allies for political powers hoping to control these regions. While some Bhil chiefs decided to assist local political powers, other clan chiefs would resort to resisting these powers often resulting in violent plunders of settled populations. With the influx of British colonialism, the anthropological urge to identify Bhils with primitivity and a prehistorical core of ancient India crystallized Bhil identity as that of Indian aborigines and native inhabitants of India. The British with their military might were more efficient in suppressing raids and plunders by Bhil chiefs. Through diplomatic ties and political manoeuvring, the British were also able to enlist peace treaties with the Bhils and also form Bhil Corps, an integral arm of the colonial law enforcement setup. 
 

 

 Certain Indological scholarship and popular belief maintains that Bhils are the descendants of Niṣāda tribes mentioned in the Hindu epics, Ramayana and Mahabharata. This association can be mainly traced to descriptions of Niṣādarashtra (the Kingdom of Niṣādas) as lying between Vindhya and Satpura mountains – the present-day heartland of Bhils. Due to this connection, several characters in the epics such as Eklavya in the Mahabharata and Sabari in Ramayana are thought to be Bhils. A similar historical and communal consciousness, along with issues of socioeconomic marginalization and lack of state assistance for rural development, has led to the development of indigenous political movements. One such movement aims to generate support for the creation of a separate state ""Bhil Pradesh"" to be carved out from specific districts of Gujarat, Rajasthan, Maharashtra, and Madhya Pradesh.","Religious Group[8] -> Indic Religious Traditions[510] -> Adivasi and tribal traditions[1050], Religious Group[8] -> Shamanism[904], Religious Group[8] -> Indic Religious Traditions[510], Religious Group[8] -> Indic Religious Traditions[510] -> Hinduism[566], Religious Group[8] -> Christian Traditions[18] -> Tribal Christianity[824], Religious Group[8]",Maharshi Vyas,1070,Western India,"Gujarat, Rajasthan, Maharasthra, Madhya Pradesh, Chhatisgarh.

1.1,994_ENR,994_ENR,994,"Elite, Religious Specialists, Non-elite (common people, general populace)","Monastic Communities of Lower Egypt: Nitria, Kellia, Scetis",Database of religion history (DRH),"Ascetic practices had been rich and varied from the beginning of Christian history. In the first few centuries CE, precedents were established for some of the ascetic practices and goals monasticism became known for, such as the existence of communities of ascetic practioners living according to common spiritual goals, and the movement from populated centers to the outskirts, for reasons that included (but were not limited to) seeking peaceful environments for spiritual contemplation. Christianity became officially recognized as a legal religion under Constantine in the early fourth century, and this policy change allowed the freedom for new modes of Christian practice and social organization.
 

 In late third- and early fourth-century Egypt, new forms of Christian ascetic practice arose in the forms of eremitic, semi-eremetic, and cenobitic monasticism. Eremitic monasticism, engagement in a solitary lifestyle devoted to spiritual pursuits apart from society, gained notoriety with the wide circulation of the Life of Antony by Athanasius, the archbishop of Alexandria. Over time, influenced by reports of Antony, who lived alone for years in increasingly remote and challenging locations, battling demons and attaining a rare level of spiritual transformation, thousands of people, following his example, moved into the desert. The three areas described in this entry were major centers for this new semi-eremitic monastic way of life. (Compare these forms of monasticism with cenobitic monasticism, a more fully communal lifestyle, as represented by Pachomian monasticism, which is described in detail in a separate DRH entry.)
 

 Amoun is credited for founding Nitria, about forty miles southeast of Alexandria (near modern al-Barnuji). This site grew quickly to include not only monks seeking a spiritual life removed from society, but additionally, supportive visitors and other travelers who would stay in the area, with the result that over time, a tourist industry of sorts sprang up in the area. This influx of visitors encroached on the monastic goal of a lifestyle of peaceful meditation, and some monks decided to move farther into the desert, into the area of Kellia (which means “the cells”). A story is told about Amoun and Antony determining the location of the new site within a day’s walk of Nitria (about twelve miles away), far enough to achieve the remoteness desired, but close enough to facilitate visiting between the two communities (APalph Antony 34). South of Nitria and Kellia is the area of Scetis, founded around 330 by Macarius of Egypt (so-called to distinguish him from Macarius of Alexandria) around a series of saline lakes (modern Wadi el Natrun). All three locations are associated with niter/natron, a salt compound used in embalming, cleaning, and Egyptian faience. These communities thrived and achieved wide renown as tales of their practices and inhabitants spread and inspired others across the Roman Empire during the fourth and fifth centuries. Beginning in the early fifth century, a series of raids by desert nomads caused destruction to these communities, and initiated a slow decline. Nitria was abandoned by the seventh century, and Kellia by the ninth. Monastic activity waxed and waned over time in Scetis, with monastic activity still there in the present day. The date range I cite for this entry (330-470 CE) is based on the estimated chronological limits for the primary evidence I am drawing from in answering the questions below.
 

 The Apophthegmata Patrum (Sayings of the Fathers) preserves collections of sayings across multiple versions (notably the Alphabetical Collection [APalph], arranged by the name of the speaker named, the Systematic Collection [APsys], arranged roughly by topic, and the Anonymous Collection [APanon]), and in several languages. (Note that because of this complicated source set, my AP citations below correspond to the numbering of commonly available English translations instead of critical editions, with the intention that a wider and more general readership can more easily track these down if interested.) The sayings tend to follow the pattern of wisdom literature: short and pithy sayings intended to teach a moral lesson. Many come as responses to requests such as, “Abba, give me a word,” and “Abba, how can I be saved?” Some are short dialogical narratives, often between a younger monk and a more experienced monk. The majority (but not all) of these sayings are associated with residents of Nitria, Kellia, and Scetis, the last with the highest proportional representation. These sayings were passed down and circulated through oral tradition and finally recorded probably in the late fifth century in Palestine.
 

 In this entry, I am going to use the shorthand description “Nitrian Desert communities” to refer to Nitria, Kellia (with Pherme), and Scetis instead of listing them individually when I mean to refer to all of them. This is not to say that there were not significant differences among people, practices, and social norms in these distinct areas; in fact, there were. But rather, these can be grouped together meaningfully under one heading for two main reasons: 1) There is a recognizable monastic culture that is shared among these areas, partially because of the close social ties and visiting practices among them that fostered a coherent cultural and even social unity despite their geographical spread, and 2) the Apophthegmata Patrum, the largest single source (or more accurately, set of sources) of information about these communities, draws from their combined cultural group as a meaningful unit.","Religious Group[8], Religious Group[8] -> Christian Traditions[18], Religious Group[8] -> Early Christianity[774]",Tola Rodrick,1150,"Nitria, Kellia, and Scetis","The region of the Nitrian Desert communities of Nitria, Kellia, and Scetis in the fourth and fifth centuries","Africa[14], Eastern Mediterranean[447]",E,N,R,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,1,0,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,1,0,0,1,0,1,0,1,1,1,0,1,0

Rabbinic Judaism emerges in Roman Palestine following the destruction of the second temple, producing legal and exegetical texts (the Mishna, Tosefta, and Halakhic Midrashim) during the Tannaitic Era. With the close of the Tannaitic era c.220 CE, the Amoraic sages Rav and Shmuel moved to Babylonia and began to teach Rabbinic traditions to the community there.
 

 

 During the Amoraic Era (c. 220-500 CE), and the subsequent Saboraic and Gaonic eras, rabbinic teachings were collected and edited into the Babylonian Talmud, a corpus nearly 2 million words long. These traditions encompass a range of genre including biblical interpretation, legal discussions, theology, angels and demons, humor, and history. 
 

 Jews primarily lived along the banks of the Tigris and Euphrates rivers. This region was home to a diverse population including Christians, Manichaeans, and Zoroastrians (the official Persian religion).
 

 As a community with roots dating back centuries, Jews in the Sassanian Empire were tolerated and permitted to practice. An official position of ""Exilarch"" was recognized by the Empire. Literary accounts in the Talmud and Gaonic sources speak of persecutions against Jews by the empire in the latter part of this period, although scholars debate their historicity.

In general, the term refers to communities influenced by the teachings of saint Máel Ruain, abbot of Tallaght, Co. Dublin (obit 792). From Tallaght, four written sources are extant: the Old Irish Penitential, the Martyrology of Tallaght, the Martyrology of Óengus, the Stowe Missal and possibly a hymn in honour of Saint Michael. Additionally, it is likely the Old Irish Table of Penitential Commutations emerged from Tallaght as well, as a complement to the Penitential. From Terryglass (Co. Tipperry), a community headed by Máel Ruain’s disciple Máel Díthruib, is extant the so-called “Tallaght Memoir” (in three recensions: the “Monastery of Tallaght,” the Rule of the Céli Dé, and the Teaching of Máel Ruain). An array of other sources may have been influenced by or relevant to the Céli Dé movement (especially, the poems of Blathmac Mac Con Brettan and the Rule of Fothad).  It is unclear whether the different settlements were united in a sort of monastic federation or were independent bodies sharing a common spirituality. The number of the communities is also unclear: the membership of Terryglass is quite certain, as are those of the monastic houses mentioned in the ""Lucht Óentad Maíle Ruain"" (in Leinster and East Munster). The term Céle Dé (while consolidated in academia) is somewhat misleading, as it was employed by religious individuals without Máel Ruain's tradition too. Apparently, they called themselves ""maic bethad"" (Sons of Life) more often than ""Céli Dé"" (Clients or Companions of God). The group was constituted by monks (both ordained and not), nuns, para-monastic married tenants and at least some high-ranking members of the warrior aristocracy (such as Fedelmid mac Crimthainn, who became king of Cashel and over-king of Munster in the ninth century). The Céli Dé were characterised by their high regard for the Old Testament, which was expressed in their strict Sabbatarianism and their concern for ritual purity (sexual, alimentary and death-related taboos). They also enforced a complex and all-encompassing system of spiritual surveillance through detailed and frequent confession, called “anmchairdes” (soul-friendship). The Céle Dé have been studied quite deeply in the past centuries (mostly by Reeves, Hughes, O’Dwyer and Etchingham in the past).

 The founder and central figure, Pachomius (c. 292-346), was born to a pagan family. During his time serving in the Roman imperial army, he was inspired by the kind treatment he received from Christians, and ultimately embarked on an ascetic life. He apprenticed himself to a local ascetic, after whose death he began his own community of ascetics. After an unsuccessful first attempt, he established a monastery at Tabennesi (c. 323), the first of the monasteries that either were established or joined his federation over the course of the fourth century.  
 

 After Pachomius’s death, there was a struggle to establish succession, but ultimately two more strong leaders, Theodore (d. 368) and Horsiesius (d. c. 387), took the reins and kept the federation thriving during their lifetimes. Most of the primary source material we have dates to these eras. We have much less data concerning the following century and a half, but the Pachomian federation appears to have continued during this period. Sometime between 537 and 548, the Roman emperor Justinian I supplanted the Monophysite Pachomian leader Abraham with a Chalcedonian replacement, at which time many monks fled, effectively ending the existence of the Pachomian community.  
 

 This group is sometimes described as the first Christian cenobitic monastic community, but this characterization is not strictly correct. It was certainly the largest and most organized up to its time, but many others had been practicing a semi-removed ascetic and communal lifestyle for years already. For example, at least three of the eleven monasteries in the federation were not founded by the Pachomians, but joined the federation after independent origins. The federation’s innovation instead came in its extensive organization in part facilitated by the Pachomian Rule, which provided a practical guide that helped in the regulation and functioning of the community.

1.1,980_ENR,980_ENR,980,"Elite, Religious Specialists, Non-elite (common people, general populace)",Pure Land Buddhist Schools in Early Medieval Japan,Database of religion history (DRH),"The rise of the exclusive practice of the chanted nenbutsu (Jpn. senju nenbutsu) was integral to the development of Buddhism in medieval Japan. It involves exclusively practicing single-minded invocation of the Buddha Amitābha (Amida)’s name with six characters, “Na-mu A-mi-da butsu”—literally meaning “Homage to Amida Buddha”—, by which to achieve salvation, birth in his Pure Land after one’s death. The teaching of the exclusive nenbutsu represents a major intellectual trend in medieval Japanese Buddhism, where liberation from saṃsāric rebirth was often thought to depend on a single practice or condition. The doctrinal root of the teaching lies in the thought of a Japanese Buddhist thinker Hōnen-bō Genkū (1133-1212). In the late twelfth century, Hōnen developed the radical claim that in the time when the Buddhist path is leading to its extinction, the entirety of this path should be encapsulated in a single practice of the chanted nenbutsu, through which he thought all sentient being will achieve birth in Amida’s Pure Land after death. While the chanted nenbutsu had been traditionally construed as one of least essential practices suitable only to those of lesser religious capacity, Hōnen claimed its centrality in the Buddhist path, because he conceived it as a sole practice that Amida found corresponding to his original vow to save all sentient beings. According to him, Amida’s selection of the chanted nenbutsu from multiple practices rendered all sentient beings equally benighted and thus urged them to rely completely on the other power of Amida’s original vow that already guaranteed salvation. This claim led Hōnen to even insist that all other practices that require self-reliant efforts are to be totally abandoned. Hōnen’s teaching was further developed by one of his disciples Shinran (1173-1262), who gave a clearer expression to the absolute other power of Amida Buddha. These two thinkers, Hōnen and Shinran, were later regarded as the founders of two prominent Pure Land Buddhist schools, Pure Land school (Jōdo shū) and True Pure Land school (Jōdo Shinshū) respectively. They promoted the exclusive nenbutsu to address primarily the soteriological equality. However, as their followers proselytized the teaching from the late twelfth century, it did entail social implications for considering whether even those persons who violate religious and social norms could attain salvation. The teaching was thus of great appeal to those deemed as the hard-to-save in medieval society. Among them were included warriors, whose profession was taking lives, and women, who was regarded as with heavy karmic hindrances. The exclusive nenbutsu, however, also entailed an openness to the antinomian impulse, serving to legitimize zealous followers’ excessive acts, such as licensed evil and intentional violation the precepts. This invited severe criticism of Hōnen, Shinran, and their followers from the religious authority of the time and urged the authority to engage in suppressions of the followers’ groups.","Religious Group[8], Religious Group[8] -> Japanese Religions[26], Religious Group[8] -> Buddhist Traditions[14]",Kentaro Ide,"1134, 1141",Japan - Early Medieval (from the 10th to the 14th century); Japan - Early Medieval (from the 10th to 14th century),"The exclusive nenbutsu Pure Land Buddhist movement emerged in the late twelfth century.

Chan Buddhism emphasizes intuition over textual study, the role of meditation in cultivating one’s mind, and the importance of master-disciple relationship in the transmission of dharma. Chan Buddhists affiliated with the same lineage were loosely organized as a group as shown in the documental evidence of dharma transmission. The Chan Buddhists disputed with each other about the criteria of enlightenment and the authenticity of the lineages of dharma transmission in their textual works, which stimulated the revival of Chan Buddhism in the seventeenth century.

1.1,961_N,961_N,961,"Non-elite (common people, general populace)",Romanian Orthodox Church,Database of religion history (DRH),"The Romanian Orthodox Church (henceforth ROC) is an Eastern Christian denomination. It represents the largest religious group in Romania (86.45% in 2011). Although the first evidence of Christianization of modern-day Romanian territories (Lower Moesia) dates back to the 3rd century, this entry’s time span runs from the achievement of the status of autocephalous Metropolis of Romania in 1885 – following the creation of the Kingdom of Romania in 1881 – up to the present day. The Metropolis of Romania was eventually raised to the rank of Patriarchate (its current jurisdiction) in 1925. The ROC is structured in Romania (thus excluding its dioceses abroad) into twenty-nine dioceses, fourteen of which have been established since 1990 (seven have been just re-opened after the communist leadership had disbanded them and another seven have been newly established). The Patriarch is the head and representative of the Romanian Orthodox Church, but decision making is the prerogative of the Holy Synod, which meets twice per year. The Holy Synod, which is the highest authority of the ROC, is formed by six Metropolitanates, sixteen Archbishoprics and thirteen Bishoprics with jurisdiction in Romania, plus some representatives for Romanian Orthodox communities abroad, including the Republic of Moldova. On a local scale, Bishoprics and Archbishoprics are divided in Protopopiates and, eventually, in parishes, which are the smallest units (Tateo 2020: 62).
 The theological framework organizing the orthodoxy and the orthopraxis of the ROC is the same of the other eight Eastern Orthodox churches, which are all autocephalous but in full communion with one another. The Romanian Orthodox faithful worship with particular devotion Saint Nicholas, Saint Parascheva, Saint Filofteia, Saint Andrew, Saint George, Saints Constantin and Elena, and Saint Dimitrie. The Orthodox Easter is the most important feast day of the year, while weekly services revolve around the Sunday mass. Pilgrimage to monasteries is a crucial form of religious practice which gathers thousands of believers every year: the Saint Parascheva is the largest one and takes place at the Metropolitan Cathedral of Iaşi on October 14th. The most popular Orthodox monasteries in Romania are Putna, Moldoviţa, Suceviţa, Voroneţ, Prislop, Cernica, and Sihastria.

1.1,919_NR,919_NR,919,"Religious Specialists, Non-elite (common people, general populace)",Catholicism in contemporary Croatia,Database of religion history (DRH),"This database entry pertains to Roman Catholicism in contemporary Croatia. The geographical area covered corresponds to today's boundaries of the Republic of Croatia and the time period is delimited from 1995 to present-day (2020). Catholics represent the majority of the population in contemporary Croatia and have a very significant influence in the culture and politics of the country. It is widely accepted among scholars of the region that Catholicism is tightly bound together with Croatian ethnicity and national identity.
 

 Undoubtedly, there are continuities between the religious group defined in this entry and other Catholic groups, in particular those in contemporary South and Southeastern Europe. Among these groups, Catholic Croats living in Bosnia and Herzegovina (especially in the region of Herzegovina) and some regions of Serbia (e.g. Vojvodina) stand out. These populations largely identify as part of a single ethnic group that shares history and traditions (religious and otherwise) with most of the population of Croatia. Nevertheless, Catholic Croats residing in neighboring countries or those living further afield, sometimes referred to as Croatian diaspora, are not included in this entry. The reason for this is that there are important differences in regard to their relationship to the state, the political status of their religious group and identity, and their interaction with other religious groups within the polity in which they live.
 

 Regarding the similarity between Catholicism in Croatia and elsewhere, there is also a significant degree of coincidence. The Catholic Church in Croatia is in full communion with the Vatican, which means that all dogma, doctrine and cannon law are essentially the same as in the rest of the world. However, particular histories and socio-cultural contexts produce unique features in tradition, practice and even belief in every context, and Croatia is no exception. In this database entry, specific elements and idiosyncrasies that distinguish Croatian Catholicism, such as the importance of pilgrimages, are elaborated in the qualitative notes of the relevant questions.
 

 Just like in the geographical dimension, in the temporal one there is significant continuity between Croatian Catholicism as described in this entry and that of preceding historical periods (e.g. S. XX). This continuity is particularly clear in the domains of religious belief and practice. However, that is not the case in the political, sociological and cultural domains. In this entry, 'contemporary' has been defined as the period from 1995 onward. This year marks the beginning of a peaceful, democratic period in the history of Croatia, existing as an independent nation, that lasts until the present. The period comes immediately after a violent war (1991-1994) where the Republic of Croatia fought against the central government in Belgrade to gain independence from the Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia. This war is part of what is commonly referred to as the Yugoslav Wars of the 1990s, which led to the eventual disintegration of the SFR of Yugoslavia. The history of this series of armed conflicts is very complex and is outside of the scope of this database. However, it is important to know that the main factions involved are generally defined along ethno-religious lines and that the conflicts were plagued with atrocities committed along these same lines. Therefore, 1995 represents the beginning of the peacetime political order that still prevails in Croatia; an order which is different from the preceding one in regard to, among other things, the status of, and relationships between, different religious groups within the country.
 

 Finally, it is important to note that, in a database entry such as this one, it is impossible to make justice to the richness and diversity of experience, practice, belief and tradition of any religious group and, especially, one with millions of members and a theological tradition of two millennia. The yes/no answers in this entry aim to reflect the most general response to the questions. However, there are cases where such general answers are not possible. This could be because there is no doctrine regarding a specific issue and no general consensus among members of the group, because there is are differences between the doctrine of the Church and widespread beliefs or practices, or simply because the issues are contested even among religious specialists. In general, when there is no obvious consensus answer to a question, this entry favours Church doctrine and teachings, in particular as defined by the Catechism of the Catholic Church. When this is not possible, or when the practices or beliefs of Catholics in Croatia differ overwhelmingly from doctrine, then the popular view is favoured. In these cases, explanations, caveats and further clarifications are included in the qualitative notes.","Religious Group[8] -> Christian Traditions[18], Religious Group[8] -> Christian Traditions[18] -> Catholic[153], Religious Group[8] -> Roman Catholic[996], Religious Group[8], Religious Group[8] -> Abrahamic[905]",Miguel Alcalde,1068,Croatia,Territory of the Republic of Croatia as of 2020,"Europe[3], Europe[3] -> Southeastern Europe[72], Europe[3] -> Southern Europe[73] -> Croatia[284]",NA,N,R,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,1,1,1,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,0,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,0,0,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,0,1,1,0,1,0,0,1,1,1,0,1,1,0,0,1,1

As anywhere, however, this world religion is expressed, understood, and practiced in accordance with the unique cultural history of Indonesia. Initially arriving with Portuguese traders in the early sixteenth century, Indonesian Catholicism has grown and flourished, becoming a powerful religious and political contender in the country and beyond. Demonstrating significant diversity across the archipelago, Indonesian Catholicism often integrates itself with local traditions and accommodates itself to the needs of different peoples.
 

 Catholics have played important roles in Indonesian history, contributing greatly to the national character and vision. In the nation’s early days, Catholic politicians and religious figures opposed the movement to require adherence to Islam, advocating instead for religious freedom. The effects of these debates can be seen in Indonesia’s current policy of monotheism that recognizes six ‘official’ religions. One of Indonesia’s principle newspapers, Kompas, was begun by Catholics in the1960s to offer an alternative to the media and perspectives of the Communist Party at the time. Today Kompas is a secular newspaper. As in many parts of the world, Catholic schools and hospitals have often provided excellent education and healthcare, especially in remote regions that the state initially had trouble reaching, in this country of over 17,000 islands. 
 

 Demographically, Catholics make up only a small minority of Indonesia’s population: 2.91% according to the 2010 census, or about 7 million individuals. Of the 33 provinces existing during this census (room was made for a 34th in 2012), the provinces with the greatest number of Catholics were East Nusa Tenggara (54.14%), West Kalimantan (22.94%), and Papua (17.67%). East Nusa Tenggara is the only region where Catholics comprise a greater percentage of the population than any other religious group. Across Indonesia, 65% of Catholics live in the countryside, while the remaining 35% live in cities. Papua, West Papua, and East Nusa Tenggara are the poorest provinces in Indonesia (According to 2019-2020 data). 
 

 The demographic distribution of religion in Indonesia, together with a lively culture of internal mobility and migration, means that certain ethnic groups have become associated in-country with Catholicism. Prominent among these are the Batak of Sumatra, some Dayak groups from Kalimantan, and some Chinese-Indonesians. Perhaps most well-known for their Catholic history and culture are the Florenese, whose yearly processions draw thousands of pilgrims from around the country. While members of these groups have gained recognition as propagating Catholicism in Indonesia, Catholics can be found across the country, of many different ethnicities and cultural backgrounds. Throughout it’s rich history, Indonesian Catholicism has contributed important ideas, values, and expressions both to the country of Indonesia and the global Catholic Church, strengthening the diversity of each.","Religious Group[8] -> Southeast Asian Religions[808], Religious Group[8] -> Christian Traditions[18], Religious Group[8] -> Roman Catholic[996], Religious Group[8] -> Christianity of the global South[1014], Religious Group[8]",MeghanRose Donnelly,1053,Indonesia,"Nahdlatul Ulama was originally founded in Java and continues to draw many of its constituents from among the Javanese, but is present beyond Java across Indonesia.

It includes believers who participate in the registered (or ""above ground"") part of the church as well as the unregistered (or ""underground"") part of the church, and those in both urban and rural locations.
 In 1949, when the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) led by Chairman Mao Zedong defeated the Nationalist Party (KMT), and established the PRC, there were an estimated four million Catholics in China. Whereas the KMT government supported them and had established diplomatic relations with the Vatican, the CCP (even before 1949) had begun to persecute Catholics as agents of foreign imperialism. Broader CCP efforts to eradicate all religion in favor of Marxist atheism began in the 1950s. Fr. Beda Chang (Zhang Boda 张伯达), the first Catholic martyr under CCP rule, was martyred in 1951. After resisting CCP pressure, a large group of Catholics in Shanghai, including its first Chinese bishop, Ignatius Kung Pin-mei (Gong Pinmei 龔品梅), was arrested in 1955. 
 In 1957 the government established the Chinese Catholic Patriotic Association (CCPA), a government body responsible for ensuring compliance with the demand that the Church in China must be “independent” and self-sustaining, with no official ties to the Vatican or the Pope. A percentage of clergy accepted these demands, and formed the state-approved official, or “above-ground” church, while the majority of Catholics, who rejected these demands as incompatible with the Catholic faith, became known as the unofficial, or “underground” Church. The CCPA began orchestrating the appointment of bishops without papal approval, which continued until 2018, when a controversial agreement between the Holy See and the PRC government was signed. Since 2018, the government has continued to pressure underground clergy to agree to a separation, or “independence” from the Holy See.
 During the Cultural Revolution (1966-76), all perceived political enemies of Mao were persecuted, and believers of all religions, including official and underground Christians were killed or suffered mental or physical mistreatment. After Mao’s death, official churches reopened, but still under the CCPA’s oversight.

1.1,972_ENR,972_ENR,972,"Elite, Religious Specialists, Non-elite (common people, general populace)",Nestorian Christianity,Database of religion history (DRH),"Nestorian Christianity as a distinguished Christian group came into existence after the Christological movement that held the theological position initially developed by Nestorius (4/5 CE). Nestorius considered Christ the Son of God and Christ the son of Mary as two separate persons with two natures rather than one person having human and divine nature. That Christological teaching was officially condemned by the Council of Ephesus in 431. The Council of Ephesus anathema led to the separation of the early Church, development of the Nestorian doctrine and ultimately initiated the process of creating the so-called Church of the East. The teaching of the Church of the East as it developed throughout history should be distinguished from the initial Nestorian teaching. Theological differences quickly had political and socio-cultural implications at the global level (relationship with the Western Church as well as other Christian communities in the East).
 

 Historically speaking, Nestorian Christians played an important role in bringing Christianity to China as well as other regions like Mongolia and India. The historical timeline of Nestorian Christianity depends on the region, socio-cultural setting and date of missionary penetration. 
 The bilingual (Chinese-Syriac) Nestorian stele (8th ct) from Xian witnesses to the early 7th century presence of Christians in the area. Nestorian Christians also reached India, and interacted with many other groups as Mongols, Turks, and Uigurs. Members of the Nestorian community played an importan role during the Islamic period when they translated many works by Aristotle into Arabic (e.g. Timothy I). Modern Assyrian Church of the East is the successor of medieval Nestorian Christians, but its doctrine today should not be identified with Nestorius. After the disintegration of the Mongolian Empire during the 14th century, the Church of the East faced rapid decline. In the aftermath of these events, the presence of Nestorian Christianity was mainly reduced to India and Mesopotamia. During the 16h century, some members of the community united with the Roman Catholic Church and were named Chaldeans, whereas those who did not united with the RCC became known as Assyrians. Nestorian Christians faced persecutions in Persia during the 6th century, but flourished in China (7-10th ct), and was also well received during the medieval Mongolian period.","Religious Group[8], Religious Group[8] -> Nestorianism[39] -> Chinese Nestorian Traditions[243], Religious Group[8] -> Nestorianism[39]",Srecko Koralija,1121,Nestorian Christianity,"Nestorian Christianity at its greatest extent during the Middle Ages.

1.1,944_R,944_R,944,Religious Specialists,Mohyla's Ukrainian Church,Database of religion history (DRH),"A community of Orthodox believers in Ukraine who abide to the standards and practices of the Orthodox religion renewed in the course of Petro Mohyla's (1597-1647) reforms in the seventeenth century. Petro Mohyla’s reforms were motivated by religious competition in the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth.
 In the 1620s, aristocratic dynasties that traditionally supported the Orthodox Church in the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth either converted to Catholicism, or disappeared. However, the Orthodox Church in Ukraine, received a new supporter in the figure of the Cossacks, armed men of diverse social backgrounds. In 1620, the Cossacks helped to elect a new metropolitan for the part of the Orthodox Church that did not recognize the superiority of the Pope. In 1632, the Polish king recognized equal rights between the restored Orthodox Church and the Uniate, Catholic and Protestant Churches of the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth. In 1633, Peter Mohyla, an energetic scion of an aristocratic Moldavian family, became the head of the Kyivan Orthodox Church.
 Mohyla’s tenure as the metropolitan marked the beginning of an important period in the history of the Ukrainian and Belorussian Church, characterized by reforms in religion and education. The learned circle of Petro Mohyla modernized the existing theological literature and introduced new genres such as collections of miracles and moral theology into the Orthodox use. To unify the liturgy and teaching of the Orthodox Church, Mohyla initiated a revision and publication of the “critical editions” of the main books of the Church such as the and the Missal (1629), the Orthodox Confession of Faith (1640), the Euchologion (1646). Trying to raise the status of the Orthodox Church in the Commonwealth, Mohyla and his circle closely followed the Catholic example of ecclesiastical modernization and even made steps to prepare the Orthodox Church in Ukraine for the second Union with the Catholic Church. Mohyla justified using Latin sources by saying that ‘there exist few Slavonic books on theology, and none at all on politics. Greek books are difficult to obtain, and they cost too much, while Latin books on these subjects are readily available (Charipova, 261). To address the problem of education, Mohyla founded the Kyivan Collegium modeled on the example of Jesuit academies in the Commonwealth in 1632. Changes in religious life also brought transformations in the religious art and architecture. New genres of theatrical plays on religious became popular and popularized by the Kyivan Collegium. The new influences became noticeable in iconography that emphasized the cult of the Mother of God and Marian piety.  
 The followers of Petro Mohyla accepted fundamental works created during Mohyla’s timeline and developed new theological genres. The most prominent works produced by the generation that followed Mohyla included collections of sermons by Lazar Baranovych (1620-1693), treatises on moral theology by Innocentyi Gizel (1600-1683), collections of miracles by Ioanykyi Galiatovs’kyi (1620-1688). This generation of religious scholars made a considerable influence on the Russian Orthodox Church by bringing new types of books to Russian markets and setting new standards for education, preaching and church discipline.","Religious Group[8], Religious Group[8] -> Slavic Religions[45], Religious Group[8] -> Orthodoxy[1021]",Ievgeniia Sakal,"331, 1101",Ukraine; Eastern Europe,Ukraine; Ecclesiastical jurisdiction of the Kyivan Orthodox Church in the seventeenth century.,"Europe[3], Europe[3] -> Eastern Europe[251], Europe[3] -> Eastern Europe[251] -> Ukraine[262]",NA,NA,R,1,1,1,0,0,0,1,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,0,0,0,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,0,0,1,1,1,1,0,0,1,1,1,1,0,1,0,0,1,0,1,0,1,1,1,1,1,1

The namesake of the order Bahāʾ al-Dīn Naqshband was born in 1318 c.e. and died in 1389 c.e. in a village near Bukhara known as Qasr ʿĀrifān and studied under the Khwājagān Sufi master Amīr Kulal. One of the common identifying features that distinguish Naqshbandī order from others is it’s Silsila, or the chain of transmission of its teachings. While most Sufi orders trace the chain of transmission from the prophet Muḥammad through the fourth Caliph and first Shīʿī imam ‘Alī ibn ʾAbī Ṭālib, the Naqshbandi trace their teaching through the first Caliph Abu Bakr Al-Ṣadīq. This is known as the Naqshbandī “Golden Chain” (Ar. Silsilat al-dhahab). Another unique feature of Naqshbandī orders is the practice of “silent recitation of God’s name” (dhikr-khafī) also known as “dhikr of the heart” (dhikr al-qalb) as opposed to “vocal dhikr (dhikr-i jahrī)” or “dhikr of the tongue” (dhikr al-lisan). The practice of silent dhikr combined with an aversion to musical audition (samāʿ) represent the “sober” rather than “intoxicated” expression of Sufism that characterizes the Naqshbandī orders. Finally, the Naqshbandī orders are characterized by a tendency toward social and political engagement. This is articulated in Bahā’ al-Dīn Naqshband’s preference for “companionship” (suhbat) over isolation (khalwat), and the principle of “solitude in the crowd” (Per. khalwat dar anjuman) which stressed that followers need not abandon their trades or economic activity for the sake of spiritual pursuits reflecting a Malamati Sufi attitude toward “livelihood” (kasb) prevalent in Central Asia. Along with another of Naqhband’s eleven principles--“travelling in one’s homeland” (safr dar watn)--Naqshbandi Sufis were encouraged to actively engage in society which may be seen from ‘Ubaydullah Ahrar’s (1404-1490) land-holdings and influence in Timurid politics, to the prominent role of the Naqshbandiyya-Khalidiyya in resisting the Russian Empire’s expansion into the Caucasus during the 18th and 19th centuries.","Religious Group[8], Religious Group[8] -> Islamic Traditions[24], Religious Group[8] -> Sufi[997]",Adam Tyson,1113,Central Asia,A number of cities that ring the Tarim Basin and are home to Turkic-speaking Muslims,"Asia[1], Asia[1] -> Inner Asia[42], Asia[1] -> Central Asia[58], Central Asia[367]",E,N,R,1,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,1,1,{01},0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,{01},1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,0,1,1,0,1,1,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,1,1,1,0,1,1,1,0,1,1
1.1,914_NR,914_NR,914,"Religious Specialists, Non-elite (common people, general populace)",Tariqa Shadhiliyya,Database of religion history (DRH),"The Tariqa Shadhiliyya is a Sufi order dating back to the 13th Century CE. It takes its name from Abu al-Hasan al-Shadhili who was born in the Ghumara region of Morocco (1196) and died in Humaythara, Egypt (1258). Originating in the milieu of the western Islamic world (Andalusia and al-Maghrib), the Shadhiliyya spread through North Africa (via Tunisia) and established a firm foundation in the Middle East as one of the prominent Sufi orders of the medieval and modern Muslim world. Influences on the al-Shadhili included figures in this western Islamic world such as Abu Madyan (d. 1198), Abd al-Salam b. Mashish (d. 1227), and Ibn Arabi (d. 1240). It also emerged in the political context of the Almohad revolt against the Almoravids, and therefore the emphasis of the former on the absolute unity of Allah (the principle of tawhid) became a component of al-Shadhili’s teachings, although it was filtered through Ibn Arabi’s conceptions of wahdat al-wujud (unity of existence). While influenced by his contemporaries, al-Shadhili saw himself not as merely an inheritor but as the creator of a distinctive path (tariqa). In the case of al-Shadhili, this path was passed on through specific prayers and formulaic sayings whose repetition is integral to the spiritual development of the disciple (e.g., hizb, dhikr, wird, du’a). Although these core practices remain present, the attitude of continued reform embodied in al-Shadhili’s teaching and reflected in the common saying ‘A Sufi is a child of one’s time’ (al-sufi ibn waqtihi) allowed certain figures cast themselves (or are cast by others) as ‘renewers’ or ‘reformers,’ and these reform movements continue to give rise to new branches.
 

 In line with many Sufi orders, the Shadhiliyya serves as a trunk out of which many branches emerge, so it is common to see references to the Shadhiliyya in hyphenated form. For example, a full lineage of a northern Moroccan branch founded in 2007 would read Fawziyya-Alawiyya-Karkariyya-Darqawiyya-Shadhiliyya while another Egyptian branch is Jazuliyya-Husayniyya-Shadhiliyya. The Shadhiliyya also has several branches of 'Western Sufism' (or led by western converts to Islam) such as the Murabitun (led by Ian Dallas aka Shaykh Abd al-Qadir al-Sufi), the Maryamiyya (founded by Fritjof Schuon), and Nuh Ha Mim Keller's Shadhili group in Jordan. This interaction is not new, however, since its Andalusian spread potentially influenced a few Christian mystics like St. John of the Cross and Teresa of Avila.
 

 What unites these distinct branches is that they trace their ‘tariqa’ (literally path or way) back to al-Shadhili through a spiritual lineage (silsila). The term ‘tariqa’ has most often been translated as ‘order,’ often drawing on an analogy between Sufi and monastic orders. However, rather than referring simply to the social group, tariqa refers to the way of life that leads one to live a pious life and potentially encounter the divine. This ‘way of life’ consists of an ensemble of exercises performed under the supervision and with the guidance of a master shaykh. For example, the recitation of prayers (ahzab) attributed to the founder or the performance of poetry from a collective corpus of poems (diwan) from famous Shadhili shaykhs are a major part of what defines a group as Shadhili.  
 

 In the case of the Shadhiliyya, some of the prominent figures include:
 

 - Abu al-Abbas al-Mursi (d. 1271): Considered al-Shadhili’s successor, al-Mursi was an Andalusian Sufi now considered to be one of the main saints of Egypt.  
 

 - Al-Busiri (d. 1294): This Moroccan author of the famous poem ‘The Mantle’ (al-Burda) was originally from southern Morocco and studied under al-Mursi in the Shadhili order.
 

 - Abu al-Qasim al-Himyari: Known as Ibn al-Sabbagh, he was the author of ‘The Pearl of Mysteries and the Gem of Purity’ (Durrat al-Asrar wa tuhfat al-abrar) that contains valuable biographical information about al-Shadhili that details his time in Morocco, Tunisia, and Egypt, serving as a primary source for subsequent biographical dictionaries (tabaqat).
 

 - Ibn Ata Allah al-Iskandiri (d. 1309): Credited with consolidating and spreading al-Shadhili’s teachings, this Egyptian leader of the Shadhiliyya is widely known for his book of aphorisms ‘al-Hikam’ (The Wisdom) and his autobiographical ‘Lata’if al-minan’ (Subtle Blessings) written in 1298. This latter work articulates a conception of sainthood connected to an inheritance from and emulation of the Prophet Muhammad.
 

 - Ibn Abbad al-Rundi (d. 1390): Born in Ronda, Spain, he is known for his commentary on Ibn Ata Allah’s aphorisms and for potential influences on Christian mystics in the region. He is buried in the Bab Ftuh cemetery in Fes, Morocco.
 

 - Ali b. Muhammad Wafa (d. 1405): This Egyptian Sufi of Mamluk lineage created the Wafa’iyya-Shadhiliyya branch with his father Muhammad, blending a spiritual heritage from al-Shadhili with a local familial authority that allowed the father to compose unique litanies (ahzab) that were spread by his son Ali. In addition to blending different modalities of sanctity, the Wafa’iyya branch reflects an earlier attempt to integrate the thinking of Ibn Arabi and the Shadhiliyya.
 

 - Muhammad al-Jazuli (d. 1465): One of the seven saints of Marrakech, this famous Moroccan Sufi wrote a compilation of prayers on the Prophet Muhammad known in short as ‘The Waymarks of Benefits’ (Dala’il al-Khayrat). His renown also made him a significant political figure and as he gained a following, he was expelled and eventually poisoned by a rival politician in 1465. The Jazuliyya-Shadhiliyya became one of the most prominent and influential branches during the medieval period.
 

 - Ahmad Zarruq (d. 1493): Labeled as a ‘conservative rebel’ by scholar of Islam Scott Kugle, Zarruq challenged al-Jazuli and his followers for their acceptance of sainthood grounded in popular politics and miraculous deeds. In contrast, Zarruq presented himself as a ‘juridical saint,’ deriving his sanctity from his knowledge and practice of Islamic jurisprudence and performing that sanctity through the moral criticism of his surrounding society. As such, he rebelled against what he saw as moral corruption (due in large part to divergent and exploitative saints) by articulating a conservative, reformed Sufism that placed a greater emphasis on jurisprudence. He is an important early modern reformist thinker that would serve as a predecessor to later Sufi reform movements.
 

 - Muhammad b. Isa (d. 1526): Founder of the Aissawa (Isawa) order known for its music, trance dances, and intricate rhythmic structures, he was a member of the Jazuliyya-Shadhiliyya that built his own lodge (zawiya) in Meknes, Morocco. In Morocco today, they are often hired as musicians for different events, making them both a Sufi order and something like a professional musicians’ guild.
 

 - Abd al-Rahman al-Majdhub (d. 1568): This famous Moroccan poet is known by his nickname ‘al-Majdhub.’ Literally meaning mad or crazy, majdhub refers to a divinely inspired madness that prevents individuals from functioning properly in ordinary life but allows them to provide insight and blessings or perform miraculous deeds. Many of his poems are so widespread that they are transmitted not as poems but as proverbs in Morocco. He was a student in the lineage of Ahmad Zarruq and is said to have founded a Majdhubi-Zarruqi-Shadhili branch that presented a rival vision of sainthood to the popular Jazuli-Shadhili order of the time.
 

 - Ahmad ibn Ajiba (d. 1809): As an initiate in the Darqawi-Shadhili branch, he was a prolific write widely known for his interpretation (tafsir) of the Quran ‘The Immense Sea’ (Al-Bahr al-Madid).  
 

 - Muhammad al-Arabi al-Darqawi (d. 1823): This Moroccan Sufi was a spiritual, political, and military leader. On the political and military side, he participated in revolts against foreign influences (Ottoman, Spanish, French) and against domestic leaders (Mawlay Sulayman) in the 19th century. At the same time, many Moroccan elites and members of the Alawi royal family were members of the Darqawiyya. In the 20th century under the French Protectorate, political expediencies resulted in a mix of confrontation and collaboration with French and Spanish authorities. As a spiritual leader, al-Darqawi is best known through his letters and is recognized as a ‘renewer’ that gave rise to multiple branches.
 

 - Ahmad b. Idris (d. 1837): Of Moroccan origin, although he did not formally establish his own order, this prolific figure had a tremendous influence on several modern Sufi reform movements (often glossed as neo-Sufi orders). Three of these influences include (1) Muhammad b. Ali al-Sanusi (d. 1859) – founder of the Sanusiyya order that resisted French colonialism in Libya –(2) Muhammad Uthman al-Mirghani (d. 1852) – founder of the Khatmiyya/Mirghaniyya in Sudan that would later become central to Sudanese politics – and (3) Abd al-Rahman al-Duwayhi al-Rashid (d. 1874) – founder of the Ahmadiyya-Rashidiyya branch that would spread through East Africa, the Middle East, northern India, and southeast Asia. His teachings included an emphasis on Islamic jurisprudence and the renewal of independent legal reasoning (ijtihad) as a way to overcome the stagnation of legal thinking and blind adherence (taqlid), as well as a spiritual doctrine of the Muhammadan Way (tariqa Muhammadiyya) that sought both the emulation of the Prophetic model (sunna) and encounter with the Prophet Muhammad in a conscious state. 
 

 - Abd al-Rahman al-Fasi (d. 1878): Initiated in the Darqawi-Shadhili branch, al-Fasi founded the Fasiyya branch in 1850 originally in Libya and later in Mecca with lodges in Yemen, Syria, and Egypt as well. His most famous disciple was Abd al-Qadir al-Jizairi (d. 1883) who led a resistance movement against the French in Algeria and was eventually exiled to Damascus where he established a circle of followers under the spiritual patronage of al-Fasi. This circle would be an important element in the development of modern Salafi thought.
 

 - Ahmad al-Alawi (d. 1933): Born in Mostaghanem, Algeria, Shaykh Ahmad al-Alawi (born Ahmad b. Aliywa) founded the Alawi branch of the Darqawi-Shadhili in 1914. While working in a variety of modern fields to encourage the integration of European and Islamic ideas Shaykh Alawi had a significant influence on several European thinkers (e.g., Guenon). He is considered a ‘renewer’ of the Shadhili for his redeployment of the spiritual retreat (khalwa) with a specific articulation (talqin) of the name Allah as a primary practice for disciples. Currently, the Alawiyya is headed by Shaykh Khalid b. Tunis and has membership throughout Europe and North Africa.","Religious Group[8] -> Islamic Traditions[24], Religious Group[8], Religious Group[8] -> Sufi[997], Religious Group[8] -> Islamic Traditions[24] -> Sufism[273]",John Thibdeau,1064,MENA + Andalusia,"North Africa, Middle East (Eastern Mediterranean), and Andalusia","Middle East[5], Africa[14], Africa[14] -> Northern Africa[64]",NA,N,R,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,1,0,0,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,0,1,0,0,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,1,0,0,1,0,1,0,1,1,1,0,1,1

A full understanding of Protestant religion today and the formative events of the 20th century on European and American culture (particularly the World Wars), benefits from a comprehension of the 19th century Protestant developments which fed directly into the creation of modernity.","Religious Group[8], Religious Group[8] -> Abrahamic[905], Religious Group[8] -> Christian Traditions[18], Religious Group[8] -> Early Christianity[774]",Ryan Fitzgerald,"1008, 975",Germany; Countries with significant Muscular Christian presence.,"The German Empire after the annexation of Alsace-Lorraine, 1871-1918.; Places most impacted by Muscular Christian missions, ideologies, and practices throughout the 19th and 20th centuries, and into the present day.","Germany[398]; United States[366], Japan[397], Germany[398], England[399], United States[366] -> Lower 48[400], United States[366] -> Alaska[401], United States[366] -> Hawaii[402], Brazil[403]",E,NA,R,1,0,1,0,0,0,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,0,1,1,1,0,1,1,1,0,1,1
1.1,943_N,943_N,943,"Non-elite (common people, general populace)",Moravian Missionaries in Nunatsiavut,Database of religion history (DRH),"The Moravian Church or the Unitas Fratrum, originated in early 15th century Bohemia, in what is now the Czech Republic. Moravians were the first large-scale Protestant Missionary movement, spreading across the globe. Missionary work, ecumenism, personal piety and an emphasis on liturgical music and worship are tenets of the Moravian faith. This entry focuses on Moravian Missionaries in Nunatsiavut, the Inuit self-governing region of northern Labrador. It tracks social changes along several centuries of occupation, as well as how Inuit resisted and accomodated Moravian beliefs and sociality. Moravians first journeyed to Labrador in 1752, after Johann Christiann Erhardt, a newly converted seaman, traveled to Greenland, where Moravians had started to evangelize Inuit in 1733, using to their advantage the connections to the Danish court of their leader Count Nikolaus Ludwig Zinzendorf (1700-1760). Erhardt became convinced that he would be able to communicate with and interact with Inuit across the Strait in British North America after reading travel accounts depicting Inuit in Labrador. The first attempt to establish a mission in Nisbet's Harbour failed, with members of the expedition supposedly killed. In 1771, the first permanent Moravian community is established on the Labrador Coast and called Nain, and soon follows a mission station at Okak in 1776, and Agvituk (now known as Hopedale) in 1777. Missionaries chose locations to set up stations based on Inuit hunting, fishing, and whaling grounds, hoping that establishing themselves near historical winter camps would encourage Inuit to ""settle"" near them. This ""settling"" was instrumental to the conversion process. It allowed missionaries to keep watch over Inuit, encourage them to attend Church and festivals, and gave them a large amount of control over the flow of European goods. Control over trade meant control over Inuit subsistence activities, as Inuit converts were obligated to participate in the Moravian cod and fur economy, rather than spending their time hunting whale and caribou, which Moravians discouraged. In 1831, a mission station was established at Hebron, located 80 miles north of Okak, in 1865 a mission station was established at Zoar south of Nain, in 1871 a sixth station was established at Ramah (it would be closed in 1907), in 1896 a mission station was established at Makkovik, and in 1904 the eighth and final Moravian mission station opened at Killinek, at the northern tip of Labrador. The Moravian missions in Labrador struggled financially throughout its history. Events that stand out include the 1918 Spanish Flu in Labrador, which killed more people proportionally in Nunatsiavut than anywhere else on earth, with a mortality rate of 71% at Okak and Hebron. The Spanish Flu was brought to Labrador by way of the annual Mission supply ship and spread rampantly through the coast. Because of the remoteness of the Labrador coast, missionaries served as doctors and administrators, as the governmental presence was minimal. Moravians, along with the provincial government, ran the residential schools in the region and were responsible for intense physical, sexual, and psychological trauma of Inuit children during the mid-late 19th century. The last missionary left Nunatsiavut in 2005, the same year that the region became self-governing. Community members continue to carry on certain Moravian traditions and many self-identify as Moravian, serving as ministers in their own communities. Many Nunatsiavut Inuit have also called for there to be a reckoning with the colonial violence inflicted by Moravian missionaries, particularly surrounding residential schools. Youth have also taken up the cause for a re-evaluation of Moravian presence in Nunatsiavut. There is currently a youth-led movement to change the name of schools on the coast named for Moravian missionaries such as Jens Haven Memorial School in Nain and Amos Comenius in Hopedale.","Religious Group[8] -> North American Religions[998], Religious Group[8] -> Shamanism[904], Religious Group[8] -> Christian Traditions[18], Religious Group[8] -> Native American (North American) Religions[38], Religious Group[8] -> Circumpolar Religions[765], Religious Group[8]",Emma Gilheany,1091,Nunatsiavut and Labrador,"This region consists of Nunatsiavut, the Inuit self-governing region of Labrador, Canada.",North America[61],NA,N,NA,1,0,1,0,0,1,1,0,1,0,1,0,0,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,0,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,1,1,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,1,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,1,1,0,1,0,1,1,1,0,1,1

1.1,985_ER,985_ER,985,"Elite, Religious Specialists",The Victorines,Database of religion history (DRH),"The Victorines refer to the individuals, thought and practices associated with the Catholic abbey of St Victor. Established by William of Champeaux (1070 – 1121) in 1108, just outside Paris on the left bank of the Seine, the abbey of St. Victor was founded as a refuge for contemplation and teaching, surviving until its dissolution during the French Revolution. This focus on teaching made St Victor part-abbey, part-school, accepting adult male novices aged 15 or over. St Victor rose to prominence in the first and second quarters of the twelfth century under a series of talented abbots and teachers, becoming a renowned centre for theological and philosophical innovation. The exhortation to ‘learn everything’ (omnia disce) issued by the order’s most famous master, Hugh of St Victor (c. 1096 – 1141), served aptly as the statement of the institution’s methodology and purpose. Poetry, metaphysics, history, biblical exegesis, humanism, trinitarian theology, contemplation and mysticism were all practiced within the abbey’s walls. What united members of the school of St Victor was the belief that the categorisation, systematisation and harmonisation of theology and philosophy possessed the salvific purpose of restoring man to the ‘image and likeness’ of God. 
 

 Denominationally, the abbey of St Victor belonged to the religious – as opposed to secular – branch of canons (regular canons) who lived communally, were attached to a church, and followed a particularly strict interpretation of the Rule of St Augustine for instruction. Like other twelfth-century Augustinian groups of regular canons, for example, the Premonstratensians, the identity of the Victorines and their ethos of reform was shaped by the Gregorian Reform movement from the mid-eleventh century that had reorganised the clergy and re-emphasised their commitment to poverty and teaching. What differentiated the Victorines from other groups of canons regular were its royal connections, the stress of a life of philosophical virtue and its specific blend of love and friendship – a trait shared with monastic orders of the day. However, in contrast to Benedictine, Cistercian and Augustinian monks, the Victorines occupied a liminal position as a ‘quasi monastic’ organisation. While monastic traits such as hierarchical system of titles, a central legislative body and a rule of silence were observed, the Victorines avoided a system of unequal mother-daughter house filiations like the Cistercians, equally emphasised theological and philosophical knowledge, and their geographical position close to the city ensured that they retained a distinctive balance between the active and contemplative modes of life.","Religious Group[8] -> Medieval Christianity[984], Religious Group[8] -> Mysticism[1053], Religious Group[8] -> Christian Traditions[18], Religious Group[8] -> Dualist Tradition[855], Religious Group[8] -> Reform Movement[866], Religious Group[8], Religious Group[8] -> Roman Catholic[996]",Jack Ford,1143,"Medieval Europe: France, England, Wales, Ireland, Italy, Germany, Denmark, Iceland and the Netherlands.","The abbey of St Victor in Paris (1108) and the approximate position of its daughter abbeys (if known) between the twelfth and thirteenth centuries, occupied by men.

 The Society of Jesus in Britain, commonly known as the Jesuits, came to Britain during a mission from Italy in 1580. Jesuits are neither monks nor friars but 'clerks regular'. They take vows of poverty, chastity, and obedience and live in community. Most are priests, but there have always been Jesuit brothers who assist the Society's mission without ordination. Many Jesuit priests also take a fourth vow, unique to the Society of Jesus, of special obedience to the Pope with regard to missions. Jesuit historiography in Britain can is typically organized by Jesuit activity pre and post suppression with regards to The Reformation in Europe. A significant aspect of the history of the English Jesuits after their restoration was their missionary outreach.

1.1,963_E,963_E,963,Elite,The Knights Templar,Database of religion history (DRH),"The Knights Templars, or the Poor Fellow-Soldiers of Christ and of the Temple of Solomon, were a Christian religious military order founded in the early twelfth century whose history is inextricably linked to the crusades. Originally founded to protect pilgrims visiting the Holy Land in the decades after the First Crusade from danger as they crossed through Muslim-controlled areas, the organisation soon expanded its duties. The order’s knights, those men who were highly skilled in military warfare (at most around 10%), came to play an important role in the defence of the Crusader States, while non-combatant members managed a large economic structure throughout Christendom, making use of innovative banking techniques. 
 

 All took vows of poverty, chastity and obedience, and promised to devote themselves to God's service just as members of other religious orders did. Its constitution guaranteed the organisation’s structure form the mid-twelfth century onwards, at the top of which stood the Grand Master, initially stationed in Jerusalem (while under Christian control) and later in Acre. He was elected for life and assisted by other high-ranking members, including the Grand Commander and Marshal. Directly below were the provincial preceptors of the Templar territories who commanded the sergeants (or 'servientes'), non-elite members who had usually joined from the lower social classes and supported the knights on the battlefield or served as craftsmen or labourers. There were also priest-brothers within the Order who were responsible for the spiritual needs of all members. Both elite and non-elite members came from all over western Europe. 
 

 They initially found support among many secular and religious leaders, who made significant donations to the order in aid of their cause, thereby allowing the order to grow significantly and acquire great wealth. However, the tide began to turn at the end of the thirteenth century. At the end of the thirteenth century, little remained of the Crusader States which had been established nearly two centuries earlier and many resented the order’s significant power. Finally, in 1307 King Philip IV of France order the arrest of every Templar in France, falsely accusing them of immorality and heresy. This move gained the support of Pope Clement V and led to the violent persecution and death of many members.","Religious Group[8] -> Christian Traditions[18], Religious Group[8] -> Heresy[854], Religious Group[8] -> Medieval Christianity[984], Religious Group[8], Religious Group[8] -> Abrahamic[905], Religious Group[8] -> Rome[974]",Emma Zürcher,1110,Medieval Christianity,Medieval Christianity around the mid-twelfth century.,"Europe[3], Europe[3] -> British Isles[70], Europe[3] -> Northern Europe[263], Europe[3] -> Western Europe[296], Levant[461], Levant[461] -> Mediterranean Coast[506]",E,NA,NA,1,0,1,1,0,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,0,1,1,0,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,1,1,1,0,1,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0
1.1,843_R,843_R,843,Religious Specialists,Bnay Qyāmā and Bnāt Qyāmā,Database of religion history (DRH),"The Bnay Qyāmā and Bnāt Qyāmā (""Sons of the Covenant"" and ""Daughters of the Covenant"" respectively) were Syriac Christian ascetics first attested in the fourth century CE. These individuals, sworn to an ascetic and celibate life, served public and liturgical functions within Syriac churches and communities. Evidence of their activities survives in remarks in a variety of religious treatises and hagiographical texts as well as rules promulgated by religious leaders. This article summarizes the known origins, social significance, and ecclesiastical functions of the bnay/bnāt qyāmā.
 

 

 The precise social and linguistic origins of the designation are debated. The noun often translated “covenant” (qyāmā) derives from the root qwm (“to stand”), and it has a wide range of meanings, including status, station, oath, and contract. Robert Murray has suggested an origin for the term in baptismal rites, where the catechumen took a proverbial “stand” and rose from the waters (Murray 1974/5). According to another view, the related noun for “resurrection” (qyāmtā) may have played a role in this use of bnay qyāmā (cf. Luke 20:36). Finally, M.R. Macina has argued that the term related to Greek kanon and tentatively proposed that the bnay qyāmā – “members of the [church] institution” – were more integrated into the clerical hierarchy (Macina 1999).
 

 

 If we are to believe fourth and fifth-century martyr narratives which claim that children of the covenant were targeted in the persecutions of Diocletian and Shapur II, “covenanters” probably existed as pre-monastic ascetic movement in the third century (Harvey 2005, 126). The most important early source is Aphrahat’s sixth demonstration which dates to around 336/7 and describes the renunciatory ideal of the bnay qyāmā. His text, replete with military and athletic imagery, exhorts the children of the covenant to reject the refinements and attachments of the world and instead embrace a spiritual marriage with Christ.
 

 

 Aside from passing references to the group in hagiographies and church histories, most of our knowledge of the bnay/bnāt qyāmā derives from lists of canons, most notably the rules attributed to Rabbula, bishop of Edessa in 411-32 (see Phenix and Horn 2017), but also in canons attributed to Maruta of Maipherqat in the fifth-century and John of Tella in the sixth-century (see Vööbus 1975 and 1982). These rules prescribe communal and celibate living, either with ones family or with fellow children of the covenant (of the same sex). It can be inferred that vows of poverty were not required based on their prohibition from usury and exemption from collections from priests. Clothing was to be uniform and modest, and outside business and legal entanglements were not allowed. Prayer and fasting were their primary responsibilities, but they also cared for church administration, the staffing of hospitals, and the care of the poor.
 

 

 One feature of the “covenanters” which distinguishes them from later monastic communities in the west was their central role in public liturgical singing. The bnāt qyāmā were particularly unique in this regard (on which, see Harvey 2005). The fifteenth canon of the synod of Phrygian Laodicea restricted singing in church to these women. According to Jacob of Sarug, Ephrem the Syrian (late 4th c.) established a choir of women to sing his hymns. In this role, they embodied and taught the eschatological and soteriological ideals of the wider religious community. 
 

 

 By the medieval period the bnay/bnāt qyāmā had declined in importance. On the one hand, the bnāt qyāmā became assimilated with deaconesses and nuns. On the other hand, bnay qyāmā were eclipsed by both clerics within the ecclesiastic hierarchy and cenobitic monks.

Dusum Khyenpa (dus gsum mkhyen pa) or the 1st Karmapa (1110-1193) founded the lineage in the 12th century in Tibet by nurturing thousands of students and building three major monasteries as his main seats. In the Tibetan spiritual history, he was known as the first reincarnated lama (Tibetan sprul sku: Taking rebirth consciously and on purpose) of Tibet. After receiving profound meditation instructions from Gampopa (1079-1153), his principal teacher, he meditated over sixteen years on the snowy mountains of Kampo Gangra and Tsurphu and conquered his inner channels and breathe, which means he found a survival skill without depending on the outer world. His fame and teachings soon spread all over Tibet, thus, many students, i.e. scholars, Yogis, merchants, and farmers, gathered together around him for seeking his teachings. 
 

 Teachings of the lineage mainly focused on a particular method of unifying Mahamudra meditation with Six Yogas of Naropa. Besides that the school practices vast and various sutra and tantra teachings within both monastic and lay audiences. Because of the group identity, monasteries, and the selected teaching transmissions, etc, the lineage was transformed into a systematic school after the Karmapa's death. The lineage has continued for around nine hundred years within the Asian countries. Recently, after 1959, led by the 16th Karmapa Rangjung Rigpe Dorje (1924-1981), the glory of Karma Kagyu reached an international audience. As a result, in the 21st century, this lineage becomes one of the largest and charismatic Tibetan Buddhist organizations in the world led by two young and talented 17th Karmapas, Ugyen Trinley and Thaye Dorje. Under their leadership, the religious organization has thousands of monasteries, nunneries, monastic institutes, and lay Buddhist Centres around the globe.

1.1,867_NRE,867_NRE,867,NA,Nyingma Treasure,Database of religion history (DRH),"The Nyingma Treasure tradition is a subgroup of practitioners within the Nyingma (Rnying ma) School of Tibetan Buddhism. Its scripture authority comes from revealed texts (with varying methods for revelation), rather than translated or transmitted texts from India.
 

 

 In contrast to the Sarma (Gsar ma, literally the “New School”) traditions, who draw their scriptural authority from newly transmitted and translated scriptures from India, the Nyingma School (literally the “Old School”) traces its religious pedigree back to the time of the Tibetan Empire. There are two modes of scriptural transmissions for the Nyingma School: (1) the distant lineage of transmitted precepts (bka’ ma); and (2) the close lineages of Treasures (gter ma). The distant lineage of transmitted precepts refers to (oral) teachings that can be traced back to the Buddha’s time through an unbroken lineage; while the close lineages of Treasures refer to revealed teachings that are said to be concealed by enlightened masters of the past and assigned to be rediscovered by predestined Treasure revealers (gter ston) in the future.
 

 

 The Treasures come in two forms, materials objects and sacred texts. The origins of these Treasures are usually associated with Buddhist masters from India who visited Tibet in the past. The most important teacher associated with the Treasure tradition is the Indian tantric master Padmasambhava (Vimalamitra is also a popular choice at this time, although his important diminished compared to Padmasambhava in later times). He is said to have visited Tibet at the request of the Buddhist king Tri Songdetsen (Khri srong lde btsan), where he subjugated many local deities and spirits, converted them to protectors of Buddhism, defeated the opposing Bon masters, commissioned many translations of Buddhist texts, and left behind Treasure teachings all over Tibet. Yeshe Tsogyel, his main consort and disciple, is said to be responsible for the concealment of these teachings, entrusting them to local guardian deities, and ensuring their successful delivery to future Treasure revealers.
 

 

 The process of Treasure discovery usually begins with a vision or a dream of prophecy. The Treasure revealer will be told in the vision or dream about the place, time, and method for extracting the Treasure. After a successful retrieval, s/he will usually receive a Treasure casket and/or a yellow scroll with encoded letters or khandroma scripts (mkha’ ’gro ma, or ḍākinī). Because of this association, as well as her special talent with language and words, the goddess khandroma, in her divine or human form, is commonly summoned in the process of decoding the Treasure scroll. After decoding, the Treasure revealer then records the teaching in writing and form a Treasure cycle. A standard cycle of Treasure teaching usually includes multiple genres, starting with a certificate authenticating the teaching, and ranging from ritual manuals, oral instructions, life stories, religious histories, prophecies, and doctrinal exegeses.","Religious Group[8] -> Buddhist Traditions[14] -> Tibetan Buddhist Traditions[116], Religious Group[8], Religious Group[8] -> Buddhist Traditions[14]",Jue Liang,96,Tibet (Tufan) - 669 CE,Nechung Cult in Tibet,"Asia[1], Asia[1] -> East Asia[37], Asia[1] -> East Asia[37] -> China[205]",E,N,R,1,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,1,0,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,{01},1,{01},1,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,1,1,0,1,0,0,1,1,0,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,1,1,1,1,0,1,0,0

While esoteric Buddhist activities suffered severely in the capital Changan, it was believed that a lay Buddhist named Liu Juzhi 柳居直 (855-907, also known as Liu Benzun 柳本尊, “the principle master Liu”) received the transmission of esoteric Buddhist teachings, especially the incantations efficacious in curing diseases and eliminating evil spirits, and devoted himself to spreading his teachings in Yizhou 益州 (nowadays Chengdu 成都) and surrounding areas. 
 

 Grottoes related to Liu Benzun’s esoteric Buddhist cult were built in Anyue 安岳 and Dazu 大足 county in the twelfth and thirteenth centuries. Both the Pilu 毗盧 (Vairocana Buddha) Cave in Anyue and the niche 21 of Mt. Baoding 寶頂 (Summit of Jewels) in Dazu preserved large-scale tableaux depicting ten scenes of Liu Benzun’s self-mutilation. Chinese scholars argue that the tableau in Dazu was produced later than the tableau in Anyue as a remodeled version of it. Mt. Baoding, as a prominent part of the Dazu Rock Carvings (listed as a World Heritage Site), was famous for a series of grottoes presenting varied themes of Buddhist teachings. According to the entry from a Southern Song geographical guidebook and the inscriptions from two Southern Song steles preserved at Mt. Baoding, these grottoes belonged to Buddhist practitioner Zhao Zhifeng's 趙智鳳 (1159-1249) carving project, which aimed at propagating esoteric Buddhist teachings inherited from his patriarch Liu Benzun as well as the secular value of filial piety. Evidence of this carving project’s emphasis on the esoteric tradition can be found as the inscription in niche 21, which writes Liu Benzun’s honorific title as “the supreme master of Tang Esoteric Buddhism.” 
 

 Due to the lack of extant historical texts, the study of Liu Benzun’s esoteric Buddhist cult was limited to the analyses of stele inscriptions, sculptures, and stone relief carvings. Most scholars hold the opinion that, contrary to the statement claimed in his biographical inscriptions, Liu Benzun did not obtain an orthodox transmission from Tang esoteric Buddhist patriachs. Moreover, scholars remain skeptical about the account of Zhao Zhifeng’s studying at the major practice hall of Liu’s teachings. Based on interpretations of the carvings at Mt. Baoding, scholars suggest that Zhao established this site as a cultic center where the cult of the deified lay Buddhist Liu Benzun was integrated with Mahayana Buddhist traditions, Confucianism, and Daoism. 
 

 The stone inscription and tableaux preserved in Anyue and Dazu areas illustrated that the esoteric Buddhist cult prevalent in the Sichuan area from Late Tang to Southern Song was a regional Buddhist cult with distinctive doctrines and practices which embodied an amalgamation of Tang esoteric tradition, exoteric Buddhist traditions, and local beliefs.","Religious Group[8], Religious Group[8] -> Chinese Religion[123] -> Chinese Buddhist Traditions[383] -> Tantric school (mi zong 密宗 or mi jiao 密教)[394], Religious Group[8] -> Chinese Religion[123], Religious Group[8] -> Buddhist Traditions[14], Religious Group[8] -> Chinese Religion[123] -> Chinese Buddhist Traditions[383]",Yi Liu,1031,Chengdu area,"Chengdu and its surrounding areas where the Sichuan Esoteric Buddhist cult was prevalent.

1.1,896_ENR,896_ENR,896,"Elite, Religious Specialists, Non-elite (common people, general populace)",Sannō Shintō,Own research (PhD) and secondary literature,"Sannō shintō refers to narratives, doctrinal analyses and artistic depictions related to the “mountain sovereigns” (jp. Sannō), the deities of the Hie shrine, now Hiyoshi taisha, in Sakamoto at the foothills of Mount Hiei. 
 In Sannō shintō, the identity of the Hie deities is chiefly conceptualised with the vocabulary and semiotic framework of Tendai Buddhism, and in special (but not exclusive) relation to the lineages residing at the Enryakuji on Mount Hiei, to this day the main Tendai centre in Japan. While the first extant sources relating the Hie deities to the Enryakuji date back to the ninth century, Sannō shintō reached its apex as a discourse in the middle ages (12th-15th century), throughout which the majority of the material extensively treating the identities of the deities was collected.
 More concretely, Sannō shintō can be defined in two ways. In a narrow sense, it only indicates discourses produced at the Enryakuji, mostly mythological and doctrinal, which establish correspondences between the deities of Hie and specific Buddhas and bodhisattvas. Although Sannō is a collective term for the whole host of deities enshrined in the twenty-one shrines of Hie, most often the “mountain sovereigns” are three of them: Ōmiya, presiding over the western compound of the shrines; Ninomiya, presiding over the eastern, and Shōshinji, also a deity of the western compound. In the “strict” definition of Sannō shintō, these are considered as emanations of, or identical to, three Buddhas: Śākyamuni, the main Buddha of the Western pagoda area of the Enryakuji (saitō), Yakushi (sskr. Bhaiṣajyaguru), presiding over the Konpon chudo in the Eastern pagoda area, and Amida (sskr. Amitabha), presiding over the Yokawa area. Such correspondences are sanctioned by monastic treatises such as the Keiranshūyōshū (14th century).
 At a broader level, however, we can say that Sannō shintō is also made up of discourses on the deities of Hie that do not quite befit the narrow interpretation. For instance, these might be mythological accounts produced at the Hie shrine, touching upon subjects such as the origin and enshrinement of the deities; accounts of the festival held each year for the deities, as well as monastic discourses which do not quite conceptualise the deities within the same correspondences of the narrow definition. In this entry I shall adopt the broader definition for three reasons. Firstly, because the medieval Hie shrines and Enryakuji were closely intertwined from an institutional point of view. Secondly, because the correspondences of the narrow definition do not represent the full extent of the diachronic evolution of Sannō shintō. Thirdly, because the “narrow” definition of Sannō shintō presupposes the “broader” one, especially from a mythological perspective. Thirdly, because textual material that presents the correspondences of the “narrow” version of Sannō shintō often also includes accounts produced not by monastics, but by priestly lineages at the shrines. Such is the case for two of the the texts which are considered synonymous with Sannō shintō, Yōtenki (13-15th century) and Sange Yōryakki (13th century).
 Taking account of this, in consulting this entry one should keep in mind at all times that Sannō shintō was not a conscious religious group, but a discursive field comprising various mythologies, ritual and devotional aspects, all joined together by being centred on the same deities and the same place. 
 Please note that this article focuses on the medieval discourse on the Hie deities, but not on Sannō ichijutsu shintō, the pre-modern discourse issued from Sannō shintō but focused on the Tōshōgū, in Nikko.","Religious Group[8] -> Kami worship[995], Religious Group[8], Religious Group[8] -> Shintō[297], Religious Group[8] -> Japanese Religions[26], Religious Group[8] -> Buddhist Traditions[14]",Emanuela Sala,1050,"Lake Biwa area, Kyōto and Mt Hiei","Kyōto, Sakamoto, Mt Hiei, and the Lake Biwa area, where the origin tales on the deities are set, and where the festival dedicated to the Sannō deities is conducted.",Japan[397],E,N,R,1,1,1,1,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,1,1,0,1,1,0,1,0,1
1.2,993_ENR,993_ENR,993,"Elite, Religious Specialists, Non-elite (common people, general populace)",Pontifex Maximus and Pontifices (Pontifical College),Database of religion history (DRH),"Perhaps, no other religious title and college has as long a tenure as the Pontifex Maximus and the Pontifical College, whose origins lay in the mythical foundations of Rome and continue today, albeit organizationally, religiously, and semantically different, in the Vatican within the Roman Catholic Church. The Pontifex Maximus and the Pontifical College has a debated origin. On the one hand, some scholars such Denova continue the traditional line that “Pontifex” means “the bridge builder” between man and the gods, and that the Pontifices were associated with the early river worship of the Tiberinus, and later Jupiter Optimus Maximus. Others such as Ribezzo and Kavanagh have argued that Pontifex comes from Sabine (Italic Oscan) and the word means “college of five” (ponti < puntes “five” and fex < trefex “college”). 
 Nevertheless, what is generally agreed upon is that the Pontifices served as advisors to the king of monarchical Rome. In Roman legends and ancient Roman historiography, King Numa (according to Livy) was one of the first Pontifex Maximus who established the organizational bureaucracy of the Roman state religion, the Vestal Virgins, and the appointment of other Pontifices. Whatever the reality of the situation was during the regal period of Rome, by the Middle of the Roman Republic, the Pontifices and their college began to have power over other priesthoods of Rome: the rex sacrorum, Vestal Virgins, the other flamines of other gods, the augurs, and, finally, the haruspices. Furthermore, the Pontifical College was in charge of the following activities: record keeping (annals, commentaries, etc.), the correct form of ritual and prayers, the Roman Calendar (“fasti”), family law – patrician marriage, adoption, and the transference of dead bodies to other burial sites. Because the Pontifices were at the top of the Roman civic cult, additionally, they approved whether or not a new god could enter the Roman Pantheon (cases abound, such as Magna Mater and Quintus Metellus building a shrine to Isis -see the entry on Cult of Isis). 
 To highlight their importance, the offices of the Pontifical College were located in Regia and the living quarters of the Pontifex Maximus was in the domus publica, both of which are situated in the Roman forum – the civic center of Rome. Additionally, the Pontifical College was originally only reserved to the patrician class during the Early and Middle Republic, but by 300 BC, under the lex Ogulnia, the Pontifical College was open to the plebeians and the number of pontiffs increased to nine (Rüpke). Furthermore, the Pontifex Maximus was subject to direct election of a selected number of Roman tribes (seventeen out of the thirty-five selected by lot - Rüpke), and remained an appointment for life. The first plebeian Pontifex Maximus was, perhaps, Tiberius Coruncanius elected in 254 BC by the comitia and first published public consultations (Cornu-Thénard).
 One last bureaucratic feature of the Pontifical Colleges was that Pontiffs could also become secular, legal magistrates and hold political office. Cases abound, and famous examples are the jurist Scaevola and Julius Caesar. Nevertheless, the Pontiffs were prohibited from holding other priesthoods, except for rare occasions (see Szelmer). Because a person could be both a pontiff and magistrate, it is quite clear that under the Roman Republic that the Pontifical College and the Senate worked closely in tandem. The Senate consulted the Pontifical College on omens, prodigies, and on what days could public and state business be held. At times, the position of pontiff could be used as political leverage, such as Julius Caesar who was elected as Pontifex before holding a single political office (Ross Taylor).
 Over time, however, the power of the Pontifical College and the Pontifex Maximus was diminished and became increasing subject to the violent political forces of the Late Republic. The dictator Sulla removed the Lex Domitia – the direct election of pontiffs by the comitia of the Roman people – and placed the election at the hands of the Pontifical College. This was undone later by the Lex Labiena, though Lily Ross finds that there was no change under Sulla and that Caesar solely supported the Lex Labiena to gain popular favor. Another restriction to the Pontificate was the Lex Papia that prohibited the Pontifical College from directly selecting a Vestal Virgin: instead, the Pontifex Maximus recommended names to be selected by lot at a public Roman contio (Mekacher and Van Haeperen).
 At last, with the dictatorship of Julius Caesar, the ensuing civil wars, and Augustus’ election in 12 BC as Pontifex Maximus (Cameron), did the unification of the Pontifex Maximus and secular power occur. As Emperor, Augustus expanded the power of the Pontifex Maximus over all religious colleges that were not subject to the purview of the Pontifical College (such as mystery cults) (Cameron), and enshrined the power of both Emperor and Pontifex Maximus in the Imperial cult. The Emperor as Pontifex Maximus continued long into 4th and 5th century, despite the advent of Christianity and the Christian appropriation of pontifices to name their bishops. Cameron points out that the bishop of Rome in the AD 360s was pontifex summus, and not maximus. Furthermore, Christian emperors did not shy away from the title of Pontifex Maximus, until, perhaps, the Emperor Gratian in AD 382, where inscriptions begin to state imperial nomenclature not as Pontifex Maximus, but as Pontifex Inclitus (Cameron). Whatever the case may be, the situation of Late Antiquity demonstrates the process in which Church hierarchy begins to shed off the influence of imperial power that will culminate in the investiture conflicts of the Middle Ages (Concordat of Worms) and the Renaissance.","Religious Group[8] -> Italic Religions[751] -> Roman State Religion[1057], Religious Group[8] -> Roman Religious Traditions[42] -> Roman State Religions[299] -> Republican Religions[506] -> Collegium[1058], Religious Group[8] -> Roman Religious Traditions[42], Religious Group[8] -> Roman Religious Traditions[42] -> Roman State Religions[299], Religious Group[8] -> Roman Religious Traditions[42] -> Roman State Religions[299] -> Imperial Cult (emperor worship)[740], Religious Group[8] -> Roman Religious Traditions[42] -> Roman State Religions[299] -> Republican Religions[506], Religious Group[8] -> Italic Religions[751], Religious Group[8]",Juan Dopico,872,Rome,City of Rome in the late first and early second centuries CE.,"Europe[3], Europe[3] -> Western Europe[296], Europe[3] -> Western Europe[296] -> Italy[373] -> Rome[374], Europe[3] -> Western Europe[296] -> Italy[373]",E,N,R,1,0,1,1,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,1,1,1,0,1,1,1,0,0,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,0,0,1,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,0,1,0,1,1,0,1,0,1,1,0,1,1,1,1,1,0
1.2,937_ENR,937_ENR,937,"Elite, Religious Specialists, Non-elite (common people, general populace)",Vestal Virgins,Database of religion history (DRH),"Introduction: No other religious group for women in antiquity has the same amount of written and visual evidence than the Vestal Virgins of Rome. The order of the Vestal Virgins belonged to the pontifical college (collegium pontificum) and was one of Rome's largest and most illustrious religious orders that spanned roughly a millennium. Their centrality to Roman religion and the Roman state is demonstrated by the fact that their lodging quarters was located on the Roman Forum itself that was, for most of its history, the civic center of the Roman Republic and Empire until Emperor Theodosius closed the Vestal Order in AD 394.
 Even the antiquity of the Vestal Virgins described in ancient literature demonstrates their importance to Roman culture, and especially the wealth fare of the state. The Vestal order was said to have originated in the times of the legendary king Numa (Cic. Rep.2.64.14; Dion Hal. Ant.Rom. II.64.5-67.1; Ov.Fast.6.357-260; Plut.Num. 9.5), but the very first Vestal Virgin in Roman mythology was Rhea Silvia: the mother of Romulus and Remus (Livy I.4.2; Dion. Hal. Ant.Rom.I.75.1-77.4; Ov.Fast.2.383-86, 3.11), thus, the Vestals Virgins were even older than the city of Rome!
 Selection Process: In order to become a Vestal Virgin, a rigid process overseen by the Pontifex Maximus ensued that scrutinized the girl’s age (no less than six and no more than ten years old), legal status (originally patrician, but later plebeians could enter), and physical condition: her virginity had to be absolute, since this was the most important qualification. An extant description of this process is recorded in Aulus Gellius’ Atticues Noctes I.12.1-8 in which other physical requisites, such as not having any impairment to hearing or speech, and exemptions are detailed. Though rather young by modern standards, the age of seven in Roman society allowed a girl to participate in both public and private rituals. Furthermore, nearly ninety percent of girls died before the age of six and those that did were more likely to survive into adulthood and fulfill the thirty-year requirement of the Vestal order. Wildfang also postulates that the age of six aided in detecting any physical defects, especially speech impediments. Finally, Wildfang also argues that the limit of the age of ten, is to ensure that a candidate’s virginity is intact before she underwent puberty.
 Once the candidates passed the requirements, it seems that the Pontifex drew lots in public during the Roman Republic according to the Lex Papia. DiLuzio notes the scholarly debate around the Lex Papia (68 BC) in which the stipulation of drawing lots “e populo” suggests that, perhaps, at the time, plebein daughters could be candidates for the priesthood. Some evidence suggests that plebein order could participate in the Vestals as far back as 337 BC, where the Vestal Minucia was executed for incestum as Livy (VIII.15.7-8) and scholar Rüpke note.
 To conclude our remarks on the selection process, it is important to note some changes during the Roman Empire. DiLuzio has shown that in AD 5 Augustus opened-up the Vestal Virgins to the daughters of freedman as well when there was a shortage of candidates. Then, under Tiberius, senators could offer their daughters directly when a vacancy occurred at the death of Occia and, thus, abrogated the 20-candidate necessity.  
 Initiation Rite: The initiation rite, what is called a “captio”, is also described fully by Gellius (N.A. I.12.13-14). The Pontifex seized the selected candidate by the hand from her father and pronounced the words: sacerdotem Vestalem, quae sacra faciat quae ius siet sacerdotem Vestalem facere pro populo Romano Quiritibus, uti quae optima lege fuit, ita te, Amata, capio (Thus, I take you, Amata, just as she was of perfect law, as a Vestal priestess to do the sacred rites that the law permits the Vestal priestess to do on behalf of the Roman people). Many scholars, such as DiLuzio, Santinelli, and Mary Beard, have noted that the ritual bear a marked similarity to those of a Roman wedding in which the bride is also taken away from the lap of her mother in a simulated abduction. Furthermore, the Vestal dressed her hair in the seni crines (six-tressed) style that was also used by brides in the Roman wedding. As DiLuzio notes, these details a symbolic wedding between the Pontifex and the Vestal virgin. Parting with Beard who sees this rite that marked the Vestal as an interstitial figure, DiLuzio rejoins that it symbolizes the complete transition of the candidate from a private, domestic figure into one in service of the Roman people and state by removing her from her house.  
 Duties: The legal, ritual, and privileges conferred to the Vestal Virgin depended upon her ability to maintain perpetual virginity, a quality that, apart from the Vestal Virgins, was not valued in ancient Roman life generally. DiLuzio notes that this need for perpetual virginity parallels concerns for ritual purity and that in the Roman mind these were one and the same for the Vestal Virgins. Furthermore, their virginity also symbolized the health and welfare of the Roman state. For example, Dionysius of Halicarnassus (IX.40) records a pestilence that affected Rome and, upon investigation, it was discovered that the Vestal Urbinia lost her virginity and was performing public rites. Upon the punishment of Urbinia and the two men, the plague was lifted. 
 Another duty, which is also linked to their chastity, was to perpetuate the fire of Vesta, the goddess of the hearth (perhaps, as far back as the period of Roman monarchy in which Vesta was the goddess of the private, royal hearth) and heart of Rome as Staples and DiLuzio note. Dionysius of Halicarnassus (II.68) recounts that the fire of Vesta went out and a case ensued in which the Vestal Aemlia was tried. In asking for Vesta for aid, Aemlia cast her garment onto the altar and a great fire appeared as if giving proof to Aemelia’s service and chastity.","Religious Group[8], Religious Group[8] -> Roman Religious Traditions[42], Religious Group[8] -> Roman Religions[900], Religious Group[8] -> Rome[974]",Juan Dopico,872,Rome,City of Rome in the late first and early second centuries CE.,"Europe[3], Europe[3] -> Western Europe[296], Europe[3] -> Western Europe[296] -> Italy[373] -> Rome[374], Europe[3] -> Western Europe[296] -> Italy[373]",E,N,R,1,0,1,0,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,1,1,1,0,1,1,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,1,1,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,1,1,0,1,1,0,1,0,1,0,1,1,0,1,1,0,1,1,0

Although involving the traditional material and ritual culture of Roman religions—temples, altars, sacrifices, festivals, priesthoods—the cult was not strictly defined, and substantial variations existed across geographic regions and time periods. The spread of the cult throughout newly acquired territories was an important vehicle for the establishment of Roman imperial authority.

According to the 2011 census, about four million Jharkhand residents are ST and the Oraon, who follow the Sarna religion, are about million. They are counted as ""other religions and persuasions"". The Sarna religion is based on animism and is sometimes called Addi Dharam. They believe in a benevolent spirit and reply upon it for their overall wellbeing. The term 'Sarna' refers to a Sacred Grove or place of worship (which is usually a Sal tree of the Shorea robusta species). The sacred grove is a small patch of forest that is protected because it is sacred and the site of deity worship. 'Spirits of the forest' are said to dwell in the roots of Sal trees, and 'spirits of the village' are said to reside in the most ancient of the Sal trees of the Sarna, or sacred grove of the village. The tribal version of Sarna when we consider this linguistically offers a very pertinent explanation of the term Sarna. In Kurukh (Oraon language) there is a term called ''Saara Baana'' which means 'work to be accomplished'. In such a way, the place where all the wishes and works are accomplished is called Sarna. Controlling these events are different types of spirits: ancestral spirits, spirits of people who died unnaturally, or forest spirits. The sacred place is home to the deity Sarna Mai. Furthermore, people’s activities are based around propitiating, through blood sacrifice, spirits that happen to reside in nature. The Mundas and the Santals go to Sarna/Jaher for most of their religious rites, but Oraons go to Sarna only once a year. This yearly visit is for Khaddi, or the Sarhul feast, and the remaining have their own specific places of worship. The highest divinity or Supreme being, the creator of the Universe recognized by the Sarna Oraon is Dharmes. He fosters all living and non-living things. They believe that spirits control all the goods and the ills of life, like earthquakes, cyclones, and floods. Second in the hierarchy are the spirits of naturally dead ancestors, called Pachbalar. Later sections belong to the village deities and spirits (Bansakti, Banjaribhut, Chatur-Siman-Garhadhora, Tusa-bhura). The fourth section are the spirits of hunting and war, called Chandi, worshipped by men; and spirits which protect pregnant women from the evil eye, called Joda and Achrael, worshipped only by women. The religion is organized around many tribal groups throughout Chattishgarh, Odisha, Madhya Pradesh, Assam, and West Bengal.","Religious Group[8], Religious Group[8] -> Animist[836], Religious Group[8] -> Animist[969] -> Sarna Oraon[1046]",Meenakshi Munda,"1122, 1136","India, Jharkhand; Ranchi, Jharkhand","Palamu, Ranchi, Latehar, Hazaribag, Gumla, Singhbhum, Santhal Pargana, Gadhwa, Dhanbad, Lohardaga","Asia[1], Asia[1] -> South Asia[40], Asia[1] -> South Asia[40] -> India[215], Asia[1] -> South Asia[40] -> India[215] -> Jharkhand[458], Asia[1] -> South Asia[40] -> India[215] -> Jharkhand[458] -> Hazaribag, Ranchi, Palamu, Latehar, Gadhwa, Dhanbad, Singhbhum,Gumla, Santhal Pargana, Lohardaga,[513]",E,N,R,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,1,1,0,1,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,0,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,0,1,1,1,1,0,0,1,1,0,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,0,0,0,1,1,1,1

Indeed, the religion of the Irish Iron Age survived to varying degrees well after the introduction of Christianity in the fifth century CE. Also unlike the Celtic cultures of Britain and the Continent, where the traditional learned class was systematically attacked and suppressed by the Romans, the pre-Christian Irish had a learned class that continued to flourish, maintaining oral historical records, overseeing the legal and educational systems, and carrying out a variety of religious functions. It is to this learned class that we owe most of our knowledge of the old religion, as their educational system made heavy use of memorization of verse and prose stories, which were thus originally pedagogical, meant to serve as mnemonic devices to help in remembering other knowledge. These included information about not only the religion but also the natural world, history, proper behavior, and much else. Because they played a key role in the educational system, they were designed to also be entertaining and thus more easily remembered. It is probably because of its pedagogical role that this oral material was eventually preserved, written down by scribes based in the Christian monasteries despite its rich pagan content. Nonetheless, this preservation appears to have been selective, as the scribes would have been inclined to minimize those elements involving the older faith. The manuscript literature thus provides us with information about many of the deities (Tuatha Dé), but it provides little information on specific beliefs or rituals, although much in the new religion appears to have been compatible with the old. It has even been suggested that Christianity first gained a foothold in Ireland through its acceptance by the younger members of the learned class, who saw it as offering only a somewhat different perspective on their existing beliefs,  But as a result, the manuscript material must be used carefully as we cannot be certain that elements within it were not invented within the monasteries rather than reflecting true tradition. A few things do seem clear. The old religion and its gods were tied closely to the landscape and the annual agricultural cycle. The gods occupied an invisible Otherworld closely paralleling our own. And there was a strong belief in reincarnation. So, to be fair, though there are many hints in the medieval manuscript literature, we really have almost no direct evidence contemporary with the period in question that can provide us with unbiased information about the nature of the religion. What I have presented here is, therefore, based on my personal evaluation of these early manuscript materials and a scattering of other evidence. Other scholars may well disagree with my interpretations, as I tend to assume more continuity in beliefs than some others do.

The origins of the Haroi have been highly debated. One position argues that they were a distinct Bahnaric ethno-linguistic group from the Champā civilization (2nd – 19th centuries). Another argues they were a group of former Cham people that fled into the uplands after a war with Đại Việt (15th century) and then resettled into uplands, midlands, and eventually, some lowland areas. The second argument is more pervasive in Vietnamese language academia and within the contemporary H’roi community. Oral histories still circulate, tying the H’roi to the refugees of the royal court of Vijaya, the Champā polity that was conquered in 1471 CE by Đại Việt. The also state H’roi had to adopt practices from neighboring ethnic groups to blend in and not be pursued by Đại Việt militaries. Therefore, their spiritual activities became quite similar to the Bahnaric groups, while retaining some Chamic (Ede, Churu, etc.) beliefs. Their language is also classified as a Bahnaric language by recent studies in historical linguistics. Regardless of the origins hypothesis, their roots seem to be in the Champā civilization, followed by a period of becoming a distinct group (15th – 17th century), while assimilating into greater Bahnaric communities [perhaps “again,” likely “for the first time”] from the 15th – 20th century.

The Vodun religion is an ancestral religion common to the population living in the west African coastal corridor covering the countries mentioned above. The deities comprise of the supreme god and intermediary gods who cover different domain of life. The supreme god is known as ‘Mawu’, a benevolent god who has the control of the whole universe. The Vodun religion in its encounter with imported religions was associated to a demonic religion and continues to lose membership due to the westernization of the region. The contemporary Vodun religion evolves in an environment where most members practice syncretism with Islam and Christianism and most members are secretive in their allegiance to the Vodun gods.
 For contemporary Vodun worshippers, the supreme god Mawu is most of the time assimilated to a monotheist god. Depending on the tribe, Mawu is either a female or a male or both. Mawu plays a moderator role in that all the intermediary gods’ actions are controlled. Below Mawu, there are seven intermediary divinities. These intermediary gods are active in everyday life and play a role in their domain. Sakpata is the god of the Earth. Hêbioso is the thunder god. Agbe is known as the god of the sea. Gû represents the god of war. Agê is in the domain of agriculture. Finally, Lêgba is the unpredictable god and serves as the contact point with the other gods. The ambivalence of modern worshippers is mostly visible in the rituals and sacrifices made to these gods in order to change the course of life in the changed world. Though some of Vodun priests can be found in the inner cities, the majority are located in rural area reinforcing the mystery and secrecy that surround them and their practitioners. Blood sacrifices, incantations, rituals, and the confinement of children and women in Vodun convents are some of the practices of this religion. 
 Contemporary Vodun practitioners have adapted their religion to their time. With the introduction of monotheist religions, Vodun was predicted to disappear. Instead, Vodun continues to survive and has expanded to the diaspora where the Vodun has become an identity issue for former African slaves’ descendants in the Caribbean islands and the Americas.

Finally, in Corinth, Isis becomes a goddess of the sea and trade, and the festival Isidis Navigium is celebrated for the beginning of the sailing season, and the celebration even entered the Roman Fasti (calendar) during the Empire. 
 Turning to the myth of Isis in the Graeco-Roman world, no other literary texts gives a complete narrative than Plutarch’s de Iside et Osiride. Even Egyptologists, such as Gwyn Griffiths and Hani, refer to Plutarch’s text and consider him a good scholar on religious history. Furthermore, the cult of Isis appears in many Greek and Latin inscriptions and it also features prominently in book eleven of the novel Metamorphoses of Apuleius, where Lucius in the form of the ass enters the cult of Isis, is initiated, experiences a religious encounter with Osiris, and recovers his true human body. In the soteriological myth of the cult, Plutarch outlines how Isis resurrects Osiris who was dismembered under the moon and killed by Typhon (Sett). Isis manages to put the pieces of Osiris back together save his phallus – scholars have offered many attempts to solve this part of the myth, including that Isis knew of Osiris’ adultery with Nephthys. From the myth, comes the idea from Egyptian theology that Osiris is the judge of the dead, who, if the deceased’s heart is lighter than a feather, would allow the deceased into his blessed and eternal abode. Isis becomes the benefactor of mankind, and the clear implication of the general narrative is that devotees of the cult of Isis had hope in life after death and that Isis may raise them up like Osiris. Thus, it comes to pass that, as Witt notes, the cult of Isis develops a priesthood, festivals days, its own calendar, and a litany of sacred texts, such as the Andros Hymn and aretalogies that are found throughout the Mediterranean world. In the hymn, Isis gives the holy word (hieros logos) whose symbol is the linen garb to those who are initiated into her mysteries. 
 The cult itself might have entered the Greek world during the Classical period, when the Athenian Assembly gave permission to some Egyptians to establish a temple to Isis in the Piraeus, as Simms has noted. From there on, in the Hellenistic Period, the Ptolemies – Greek rulers of Egypt – who used both Osiris and Isis to legitimize their pharaonic rule continue to spread cult activity primarily in Alexandria. Ptolemy I Soter was said to have invited a Timotheus to syncretize the Egyptian cult with Greek ideas, based on the Eleusian mysteries and Demeter worship (Witt). The Ptolemies and their wives, such as Arisinoe II, would continue to use the cult in order to establish their political authority by associating themselves with Osiris and Isis. From Alexandria, the cult spread to the rest of the Greek world and arrived to Delos. Scholars have traced that the cult’s arrival to South Italy originated from Delos when merchants were forced to flee due to conflict with the Seleuccids. In Italy, the cult can be found relatively early in the 3rd century BC in the Greek speaking portions – Sicily and Magna Graecia through numismatic and archaeological evidence, such as temples at Puteoli and Pompeii (Rüpke). From there, in the 1st century BC, the cult of Isis enters Rome under Sulla, and the Pontifex Maximus Metellus funded the construction of an Isis shrine (Iseum Metellinum). The cult, however, did not enjoy immediate success. Among the non-aristocratic classes, the cult offered an alternative and a challenge of the authority of the Senate in competing with the gods of Jupiter and Venus (Rüpke). The Roman Senate sought to ban the cult activities in the 50s and 40s BC and political violence involving factions of Pompey and Clodius involved members of the cult of Isis. During the Civil Wars, Antony and Cleopatra fashioned themselves as Osiris and Isis which led to Octavian, after his victory at Actium in 31 BC, to prohibit the cult from entering the pomerium of Rome. The hostility towards the cult reached its pinnacle in Tiberius when in AD 19, a Roman by the name of Mundus seduced a married Roman matron Paulina with the aid of the priests of the temple of Isis. Upon investigation, Tiberius banned the cult, destroyed the temple, crucified the priests, and banished Mundus into exile. From there, under Caligula and Nero, the cult of Isis enjoyed prestige and became one of the most popular mystery cults throughout the Mediterranean until the arrival of Mithraism and Christianity. With Theodosius edict to close all pagan temples in AD 394, the fate of the cult was pretty much sealed, although there is some evidence to suggest that in certain peripheral areas the cult lasted until the 6th century AD.","Religious Group[8], Religious Group[8] -> Roman Religious Traditions[42], Religious Group[8] -> Roman Religious Traditions[42] -> Egyptian Religions[732] -> Isis Cult[1041], Religious Group[8] -> Egyptian Religions[20], Religious Group[8] -> Greek Cult[982], Religious Group[8] -> Roman Religious Traditions[42] -> Egyptian Religions[732]",Juan Dopico,132,Roman Empire (Greatest Extent),"Most of Western Europe and the Mediterranean, but tagged only as ""Western Europe"".","Europe[3], Europe[3] -> Western Europe[296]",E,N,R,1,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,1,1,1,0,1,1,1,0,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,0,0,1,1,0,1,0,1,1,0,0,1,1,0,1,0,0,1,1,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,0,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,0,1,1,0,1,0,0,1,0,1,0,1,1,1,1,1,1

Marpa’s principle student was Jetsun Milarepa (approximately 1040-1123), who passed on the teachings to his students, including Gampopa (1079-1153) from whom the Karma Kagyu, Tselpa Kagyu, Barom Kagyu and Phagdru Kagyu sects were founded. Gampopa’s student Phagmo Drupa (1110-1170) was the teacher of the founder of the Drikung Kagyu sect, Jigten Sumgon (1143-1217). Jigten Sumgon was the grandson of Achi Chokyi Dolma, a great female practitioner who would later come to be a protective deity of the Drikung Kagyu. Jigten Sumgon founded the monastery of Drikung Thil in Central Tibet, which would come to be the center of religious activity for the Drikung Kagyu. The main teachings of the Drikung Kagyu are the Six Yogas/Dharmas of Naropa, the Jewel Ornament to Liberation of Gampopa, the Fivefold Mahamudra (thus named by Phagmo Drupa), the Gongchik of Jigten Sumgon, as well as the biographies and devotional songs of the great Drikung masters (most prominently the 100,000 songs of Milarepa). Up until the 17th century, power was primarily passed hereditarily within the Kyura clan. The Kyura lineage ended with the brothers Gyalwang Konchog Rinchen (1590–1654) and Kunkhyen Rigzin Chödrak (1595–1659). They were recognized as the 1st Chetsang (older brother) and 1st Chungtsang (younger brother). Both of these positions have passed through reincarnation up until present day. They are now held by Chungtsang Rinpoche Tenzin Chokyi Nangwa (b. 1942), who lives in Tibet, and Chetsang Rinpoche Konchog Tenzin Kunsang Trinley Lhundrup (b. 1946), who lives in India.

2.1.1,960_ENR,960_ENR,960,"Elite, Religious Specialists, Non-elite (common people, general populace)",Bön (Bon),Database of religion history (DRH),"The word ‘Bön’ (Tib. Bon) represents a complicated and contested term, carrying various meanings across time, space, and different groups. Presently it usually refers to the more specifically called Yungdrung Bön (g.Yung drung Bon), literally ‘Eternal Bon’, on which this entry focuses – a religious tradition academically mostly taken as a school of Tibetan Buddhism. The other recognised main schools are: Geluk (dGe lugs), Nyingma (rNying ma), Kagyü (bKa’ rgyud), Sakya (Sa skya), and Jonang (Jo nang). Yet, Bön has historically maintained a strong non-Buddhist and minority identity, accentuating own appellation bön in opposition to Buddhism, chö (chos). Yungdrung Bön is currently spread, as the other schools, in the culturally Tibetan parts of the PRC – with largest communities in East Tibet (Sichuan, Gansu, Qinghai Provinces); in the Himalayas: Nepal (Mustang, Dolpo, Kathmandu), following the post-1959 exile also in India (Himachal Pradesh, thinly in Uttar Pradesh, Sikkim, Ladakh), Bhutan, and growing globally: in Europe (with a monastery in France), USA, Canada, Mexico, Mongolia, and venturing into South-east Asia. 
 Attested meanings of the term bön refer to: (1) ‘bönpo’ (bon po) ritual specialists conducting funerary rites and invocations of deities in the Tibetan Empire (7th-9th century) controlling a great part of Central Asia, with ‘bön’ likely denoting ‘ritual’; (2) all historical and contemporary Tibetan religious notions and practices that do not derive from Buddhism and Indian influences, i.e. mainly popular religion encompassing traditions sometimes labelled ‘shamanism’; in an extended understanding non-Buddhist elements of Tibetan culture, a notion currently popular in Tibet and propagated by the PRC (along with strong Chinese historical impacts); (3) Yungdrung Bön; (4) (lha)bön ((lha) bon), or sipé lhabön (srid pa’i lha bon), local traditions generally lacking Buddhist influence unrelated to Yungdrung Bön, centred on mundane rituals, worshipping a range of own divinities, found in small areas of East Tibet and the Himalayas (mainly Bhutan, Arunachal Pradesh). 
 Bönpos, adherents of Yungdrung Bön, have asserted own succession of the Imperial bön, which they regard as an independent Tibetan autochthonous religious system, gradually suppressed by Buddhism (officially adopted by the Tibetan Empire in the 7th century) and a predecessor of bön (2), (3), (4). According to historical evidence, Yungdrung Bön begun crystallising in the 11th century under the influence of Buddhism during its second diffusion in Tibet, developing monasticism and adopting other Buddhist features. Yungdrung Bön has thus shared cosmology, soteriological goals (awakening), and key features of ritual and spiritual practice with Tibetan tantric Buddhism, but has maintained more Tibetan non-Buddhist elements. The non-Buddhist identity is very strong and derives from own sources of tradition and lineages of power and teachings: divine founder of the religion Tönpa Shenrap Mibo (sTon pa gShen rab mi bo), claimed to significantly predate Buddha Shakyamuni and hail from the Zhangzhung (Zhang zhung) kingdom in West Tibet; own canon: voluminous Ka (bKa’, ‘The Word’ or ‘Teachings’) and Katen (bKa’ rten, ‘Support of Teachings’) collections; distinct iconography and details of material culture; also deliberate inversions of Buddhist categories (for instance anti-clockwise circumambulation).","Religious Group[8] -> Tibetan Buddhism[992], Religious Group[8] -> Tantric Buddhism[993], Religious Group[8] -> Bön (Tibetan: bon)[13], Religious Group[8] -> Buddhist Traditions[14], Religious Group[8] -> Indic Religious Traditions[510], Religious Group[8]",Anna Sehnalova,1107,Tibet and the Himalayas,"Greater Tibet', Tibetan cultural areas of the Tibetan Plateau and the Himalayas","Asia[1], Asia[1] -> East Asia[37], Asia[1] -> East Asia[37] -> China[205]",E,N,R,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,1,1,1,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,{01},1,1,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,0,0,1,1,0,1,1,0,1,0,0,1,0,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,1
2.1.1,962_ER,962_ER,962,"Elite, Religious Specialists",Amdo Gelukpa,Database of religion history (DRH),"Amdo is a vast region on the Sino-Tibetan borderlands, which includes parts of Kokonor, South Gansu, and North Sichuan. Amdo is occupied by diverse communities, including Tibetan, Mongol, Monguor, Chinese and Turkic Muslims, etc. In the thirteenth century, Tibetan Buddhism developed thrivingly in Amdo during the reign of the Mongol Empire. As the middle ground between Tibet and China, Amdo became a critical cultural nexus of diverse cultures. In this context, Tsongkhapa, the Geluk School's founder, was born in Amdo. Starting from the fourteenth century, the Geluk School spread widely in Amdo. Because of the Khoshut Mongols' patronage after the late sixteenth century, the Gelukpa power rose promptly in Amdo. From the seventeenth to the eighteenth century, the development of the Gelukpa power in Amdo was directly related to the geopolitical policy of the Qing dynasty. Along with the Manchus and Mongols' patronage, the center of Amdo Gelukpas gradually moved from South Gansu to Kokonor. This significant phenomenon about Amdo Gelukpas was related to the westward movement of the Qing frontier policy. The development of the Gelukpa power in Amdo has several characteristics. Many Geluk monasteries took over institutional and religious legacies from other religious sects in Amdo, especially from the Sakya School. Along with the expansion of the Gelukpas in Amdo after the fifteenth century, many Amdo Buddhist communities converted to the Geluk School; however, they still preserved some original traditions and social practices in the pre-Geluk period. One of the most significant traits is the close connection between the Buddhist reincarnation system and local aristocratic power. It is widely known that the Sakya School's inheritance system is mainly based on kinship, especially the relationship between uncle and nephew. Because of the Mongol Empire's sponsorship, many Sakyapa priests and followers moved to Amdo and promptly dominated the region. After that, they established powerful local clans and monastic communities by practicing inheriting the Sakya School's lineage. In so doing, either monastic priests or local governors in the region were usually chosen from those families affiliated with the Sakya School. As both patrons and priests shared the same lineage, the political and religious powers tied together closely in Amdo. After these families gradually converted to the Geluk School after the fifteenth century, they still followed the inheritance system based on the patron-priest concept of the Sakya tradition, in which kinship played a critical role (See: Kung, 2018.). This unique phenomenon of the unity of politics and religion based on kinship profoundly influenced the historical development of Amdo Gelukpas until the early twentieth century. For instance, the Tenth Panchen Lama also held the Sakya lineage of the Khön Family.","Religious Group[8], Religious Group[8] -> Tibetan Buddhism[992], Religious Group[8] -> Tantric Buddhism[993], Religious Group[8] -> Buddhist Traditions[14]",Ling-Wei Kung,1109,Amdo,Gelukpa Buddhist communities in Amdo,"Asia[1], Amdo[505], China[504], Tibet[503]",E,NA,R,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,0,1,1,0,1,0,1,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,1,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,0,0,1,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0

The country was divided into different banners ruled by nobles who could claim their legitimacy to their ancestral connections to Chinggis Khan. The nation was essentially feudalist, with noble families connected to temples who were often headed by reincarnation lineages. By 1911, when Mongolia declared independence from the crumbling rule of the Manchurian Dynasty, Buddhist monasteries connected to Tibetan lineages (mostly Gelug) had amassed considerable wealth and power in the preceding centuries. In the 1918 census around 110 000 people were monastics, around half of the adult male population. Around one third of these were celibate living within monastic compounds. The wealth of the temples varied greatly with some, such as the great estate of the Tibetan-born reincarnation the Eighth Javzandamba, ruling over 90 000 disciples. During the erratic beginnings of the twentieth century, Buddhist institutions saw a short-lived consolidation of their power as the Eighth Javzandamba took a position of seniority over the nation from 1911. In 1920, following a series of escalating incursions from the south, a group of revolutionary Mongolians travelled north in search of Russian assistance. In 1921 a group of White Russians, led by the notoriously brutal Russian Baron Ungern-Sternberg, arrived in the capital Khüree (now Ulaanbaatar) removing Chinese authorities and re-installing the power of the Eighth Javzandamba. Dismayed by the continued presence of the ‘Mad Baron’ in the country, in July 1921 the group of revolutionary Mongolians returned, backed by the Bolsheviks and entered the capital to oust the Baron’s army. Following the Eighth Javzandamba’s death in 1924, in 1926, the new socialist government began a campaign to undermine the power and influence of the monastic establishments. Initially this campaign was relatively non-violent and set about to decrease the wealth and authority of Buddhist institutions through heavy taxation and education campaigns. From 1929 to 1932 the country saw intensified violence against monasteries, followed by a reprieve when the excessive use of force and the destruction of sacred items caused uprisings and rebellions. Following this period posthumously named ‘The Leftish Deviation’, the government returned to mostly non-violent strategies, encouraging class consciousness among the poorer herders and disciples and increased the taxation of the temples. In 1937 the policies once again turned violent under the rule of prime minister Choibalsan, focusing on campaigns against Buddhist lamas, ethnic Buryats, intellectuals and other sources of opposition. Monasteries were destroyed and looted, lamas forcibly disrobed, and around 13 000 lamas were killed. As Christopher Kalponski writes “In September 1937, there had been 83,203 lamas in the monasteries. On 25 July 1938, there were 562.” By 1940 there were 251 lamas left in the country and for the next 50 years the government continued its policy of religious repression. The public practice of religion was outlawed, with only one monastery, Gandantegchenlin Khiid, functioning as a showcase for the nation’s religious tolerance.","Religious Group[8], Religious Group[8] -> Buddhist Traditions[14]",Saskia AbrahmsKavunenko,1081,Mongolia during the revolutionary period.,"Post Qing-era Mongolia, sometimes known as 'Outer Mongolia'.","Asia[1], North Asia[441]",E,N,R,1,1,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,0,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,1,0,1,1,1,1,0,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,1

2.1.1,983_ENR,983_ENR,983,"Elite, Religious Specialists, Non-elite (common people, general populace)",Tibetan and Himalayan Mundane and Landscape Cults,Database of religion history (DRH),"Across the large geographical space of the Tibetan Plateau and the Himalayas, cultures and societies of speakers of Tibetic and Qiangic languages share certain religious notions and similar ritual practices which do not derive from Buddhism or Yungdrung Bön (g.Yung drung Bon) but rather relate to local natural environments and social structures. Being very variable and difficult to subsume under one term, these localised religious cults have been called ‘popular’ (Bell 1931), ‘nameless’ (Stein 1972), ‘folk’ (Tucci 1980), often also ‘shamanism’ or ‘bön’ (bon), and in specific cases ‘pagan’ (Ramble 2008) and ‘mundane’ (Huber 2020). They are concerned with mundane aims of well-being and prosperity, fecundity and progeniture, health, protection and warfare, and general worldly success; not with soteriology. They most likely represent indigenous, pre-Buddhist cults of Tibet and the Himalayas.
 

 Cosmologically, the world is threefold, composed from (1.) the upper heavenly sphere of deities (lha / lha); (2.) the middle earthly level inhabited by humans and other, including supernatural, beings (for ex. nyen / gnyan, tsen / btsan, dü / bdud, etc.), usually rendered into English as gods, deities, spirits, demons, etc.; and (3.) the lower chthonic realm of various other beings (widely called lu / klu). Humans in the intermediate level come into contact with beings, more or less powerful, benevolent or malicious, from all the three permeable spheres, and must develop methods of communication and coexistence with them in order to live and prosper. These typically consist of prescribed behavior and taboos, invocations, offerings and other ritual means, by which people acquire forces of good fortune, prosperity and fertility, and avoid possible punishments. These beings are often anthropomorphic and perceived to dwell in physical structures, both natural and man-made: mountains, hills, rocks, boulders, water sources, plants; hearth, the main house pillar; and also in the human body. As they can be in fact omni-present, they often influence people’s lived daily realities and practices. Probably thousands of such deities exist, at times organised into hierarchised groups. 
 

 Territorial deities, commonly called yüllha (yul lha, ‘god of a valley/region’), zhidak (gzhi bdag, ‘lord of a base/place/soil’), yüllha zhidak (yul lha gzhi bdag), or yülsa (yul sa, ‘lord of earth/place’), tend to be the most prominent, and among them mountain deities believed to inhabit mountain glaciers and peaks and govern their surroundings. Mountain deities, and certain deities of the celestial realm, are sometimes perceived as ancestors of descent lines and whole communities, usually tied to patrilines and one’s birth place. Mountains and their deities have become important symbols of regional and, especially since the mid-20th century, also Tibetan national identity, such as Mt Kailash, Gang Tisé (Gangs ti se) or Gang Rinpoche (Gangs rin po che) in Tibetan, in West Tibet, and Anyé Machen (A myes rma chen) in East Tibet. The paramount Mt Everest is also sacred and hosts goddess Jomo Langma (Jo mo glang ma). Almost all local cults have been historically exposed to Buddhist and Yungdrung Bön domination, and in most cases were to varying degrees incorporated into the two Doctrines. Vice versa, they have influenced all schools of Tibetan Buddhism, including Yungdrung Bön, by bringing strong local elements into even common monastic practice. Many local cults are very vulnerable also to current globalising and modernisation pressures.","Religious Group[8] -> Tibetan Buddhism[992], Religious Group[8] -> Tantric Buddhism[993], Religious Group[8] -> Animist[836], Religious Group[8] -> Animist[836] -> ancestor veneration[933], Religious Group[8], Religious Group[8] -> Shamanism[904], Religious Group[8] -> Bön (Tibetan: bon)[13], Religious Group[8] -> Buddhist Traditions[14], Religious Group[8] -> Natural Religion[985] -> Nature worship[1047], Religious Group[8] -> Natural Religion[985]",Anna Sehnalova,1107,Tibet and the Himalayas,"Greater Tibet', Tibetan cultural areas of the Tibetan Plateau and the Himalayas","Asia[1], Asia[1] -> East Asia[37], Asia[1] -> East Asia[37] -> China[205]",E,N,R,1,1,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,1,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,1,0,1,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,1,0,1,1
2.1.1,852_ENR,852_ENR,852,"Elite, Religious Specialists, Non-elite (common people, general populace)",Pre-Christian Religion / Paganism in Ireland,Database of religion history (DRH),"Historical pagan, pre-Christian Ireland was an autonomous island region of Iron Age Europe inhabited by Celtic language speaking tribes. Encompassing 32,595 square miles, it is situated in close proximity to Britain and the Isle of Man, as well as parts of Continental Europe. 
 

 Prior to the introduction of Christianity in the fifth century CE, the people of Ireland did not typically create written records of any size. A system of writing known as Ogam was designed specifically for the Irish language (an early form referred to as Primitive Irish), created sometime between the late 4th - early 5th centuries, probably in south-west Ireland. It was typically used for memorial stones and dedications, although names and other data were sometimes recorded on personal items. 
 

 Because of the lack of contemporary written source materials - native or foreign - much of our knowledge of the region is obtained through archaeology. Iron Age Ireland was inhabited by numerous tribes, each ruled by a king to whom the people owed their loyalty. 
 Society appears to have been hierarchical, and also organized around kin-groups.
 

 In addition to kings and nobles, there were learned professions such as the druid and harpist, as well as skilled craftspeople. The land contained numerous small farmsteads focused on the production of cereal crops and other plant foods and resources, as well as the herding of livestock (primarily cattle).
 

 In addition to archaeology, useful comparisons pertaining to culture and religion have been made with other Iron Age Celtic-speaking cultures in Britain, Gaul, Continental Europe and Galatia (Asia Minor). 
 

 The religion of pre-Christian pagan Ireland consisted of polytheism, with the possibility of animism as well. Our main evidence includes archaeological data pertaining to the location, layout and orientation of ritual sites, votive offerings and depositions, and burial practices, as well as informed analysis of ethnographic accounts of Gaulish religion and belief, including the training and functions of the Druidic class of religious specialists.
 

 Linguistic analysis and comparisons of place-names, personal names, theonyms, and socio-religious terminology from other Celtic regions has proven fruitful, as has examination of possible parallels with religious themes and symbolism from early medieval written sources from Britain, Continental Europe, and Ireland itself.
 

 From the available evidence we can discern a vibrant pagan culture in Iron Age Ireland, whose people attended socio-religious gatherings at local or tribal assembly sites. Depositions of votive offerings were also made into ritual shafts or pits, and bodies of water (rivers, lakes, bogs, ocean).
 

 As in many traditional cultures, religion would have infused nearly every aspect of daily life, and archaeological work has focused on the interconnection between religious spaces, local settlements, and the landscape, as well as cosmological elements. 
 

 In addition to archaeology, early medieval Irish literature is an important potential source of information. While written down after the introduction of Christianity, early Irish law tracts are believed to reflect aspects of native Irish law, elucidating certain aspects of society and culture. These included an appreciation and respect for values such as truth, wisdom, honesty, loyalty and courage, as well as music, eloquence, poetry and skill.
 

 In addition, there are numerous sagas, poems, mythic narratives and onomastic tales which mention supernatural beings referred to as the 'Síabra' or 'Áes Síde,' and later as the 'Túatha Dé Danann' (the 'People or Tribes of the Goddess Danu'). 
 

 While there is considerable scholarly debate about this body of literature and what pre-Christian material it contains or reflects, the sheer volume of it - and the amount of material pertaining to beings expressly described as gods or goddesses (as well as other mythological or visionary material and themes) - must not only be acknowledged but interpreted with some care and discernment. 
 

 According to the literature, there appear to have been numerous Irish deities, whose attributes were associated with aspects of culture (healing, prosperity, warfare, magic, horsemanship, food and drink, arts, crafts, seership and fertility) as well as those with some associations with aspects of the natural world (rivers, wells, trees, groves, animals and birds).
 

 It should be noted that historical Irish paganism was not solely (or perhaps even primarily) an ""earth religion,"" as that term is commonly understood in the 21st century. The attributes of the deities are highly concerned with culture as well as nature, and this appears to be the case in other Celtic regions as well. 
 

 What is extremely prevalent in the archaeological evidence and the literary sources is a focus on interactions and relationships between human beings and the divine, whether that entails deities, ancestors and / or the Otherworld realms. 
 

 If the laws and the literature reflect
 any semblance of earlier cultural beliefs and practices, it is reasonably safe to assume that religious ceremonies would have been presided over by members of a highly-trained Druidic class, who probably also served in a judicial capacity. They still had legal status in Ireland at the time of the 7th-8th century CE law tracts, although this diminished over time. 
 

 In Irish, British and Continental written sources, the Druids of history were described as arbitrators, moral and natural philosophers, and experts in the nature of (and communication with) the divine. They appear to have also provided counsel to leaders, performed divination, and engaged in healing rituals. In addition, they served as instructors to druidic candidates over a period of many years, and this training involved a great deal of memorization, as this was an orally transmitted culture. 
 

 In Gaul, the Druids apparently taught the people that the soul was immortal and after death would enter another body, and that the people should ""honour the Gods, do no ill deed, and practice valour."" Early Irish literature provides examples of similar concepts, and much else besides. 
 

 While the debate over the content of the literary sources was in recent memory stalled in a stand-off over 'nativist' and 'non-nativist' stances, in more recent times Celtic Studies has participated in more refined approaches. By engaging with each text in a nuanced and informed manner, and incorporating useful data from interdisciplinary and comparative methodologies, researchers have the potential and capacity to further illuminate the religious beliefs and practices of Iron Age and early medieval pagan Ireland. 
 

 It is important to note that the historically documented training and practices of the Druids in Celtic-speaking regions of Iron Age Europe have little or nothing to do with modern Neo-Pagan druidism or druidry, which are recent occult-based, earth-honoring religions developed in the 19th and 20th centuries.","Religious Group[8] -> Indo-European Religion[957], Religious Group[8] -> Celtic paganism[958], Religious Group[8] -> Celtic Polytheism[959], Religious Group[8] -> Irish Paganism[960], Religious Group[8] -> Irish Polytheism[961], Religious Group[8] -> Celtic Religions[16], Religious Group[8]",Sharon Paice MacLeod,1019,Iron Age Ireland,Ireland during the European Iron Age and the early Medieval era,"Europe[3], Europe[3] -> Western Europe[296], Ireland[420]",E,N,R,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,1,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,1,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,1,0,1,1,1,0,0,0,1,1,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,0,1,0,1,1
2.1.1,946_ER,946_ER,946,"Elite, Religious Specialists",Nyingma (rnying ma),Database of religion history (DRH),"The Nyingma, or “Ancient” lineage refers to the oldest of the four major lineages of Tibetan Buddhism. Distinguished from followers of the later Sarma (Tibetan: gsar ma) lineages, which includes the Kadam, Sakya, Kagyu, and later Gelug, Nyingma refers to those who adhere to the earliest (pre-tenth century) translations of Buddhist teachings arriving in Tibet, as well as a series of treasure (T: gter ma) text revealed from the eleventh century onwards. Renowned for their adherence to a range of esoteric, predominantly tantric Buddhist practices, as well as unorthodox behavior, Nyingma followers served as motivation for periodic reforms throughout Tibetan history, each allegedly “returning” to the ethical roots and meditative discipline of Indian Buddhism. 
 

 According to the Nyingma lineage, the primordial teacher is Samantabhadra (T: kun tu bzang po). Depicted without clothing and vivid blue in color, he represents the untainted wisdom of the all Buddhas of the three times and ten directions. In human form, the Nyingma lineage finds its roots in the Indian master Padmasambhava (T: pad+ma 'byung gnas) who is credited with introducing the first coherent and comprehensive presentation of the Buddhist path to Tibet. He is often referenced along with Shantarakshita (Sansrkit: Śāntarakṣita), the great Indian pandit, and Vairotsana (T: bai ro tsa na), the great translator, delineating the three most important early Nyingma thinkers. The historical center of the lineage is found in Samye (T: bsam yas) monastery in central Tibet. Constructed in the eighth century, Samye monastery was the first successfully constructed monastery in Tibet. After years of wrestling with demons, King Trisong Detsen (T: khri srong lde btsan), requested Padmasambhava to subjugate the antagonistic demon, which he did, and the monastery was miraculously completed overnight. 
 

 Renowned today for their erudite descriptions of the Great Completeness (T: rdzogs pa chen po) meditative system, the Nyingma lineage experienced a resurgence in the fourteenth century with the renowned scholar-yogi Longchen Rabjam (T: klong chen rab ‘byams). Longchenpa, as he is commonly referred to, both revealed new treasure teachings and consolidated much of the existent tantric materials found within the early Nyingma lineage. His extensive writings on topics such as the nine vehicles (T: theg pa dgu; a defining religious shema of the Nyingma, the subtle body, meditation practice, and most importantly the Great Completeness, revived the Nyingma lineage during and after his life. 
 

 Extending across the Tibetan plateau to include all three Tibetan states (Utsang, Kham, and Amdo), as well as Bhutan and modern-day Indian state of Ladakh, the Nyingma lineage flourished in many sub-lineages throughout the centuries, resulting in a vibrant array of contemplative and scholarly practices.","Religious Group[8], Religious Group[8] -> Tibetan Buddhism[992], Religious Group[8] -> Tantric Buddhism[993], Religious Group[8] -> Buddhist Traditions[14]",Justin Kelley,"1092, 1129",Tibetan Plateau; Tibetan Plateau.,The area within which the majority of residents adhere to what is broadly understood asHimalayan Buddhism,"Asia[1], Asia[1] -> Himalayas[363], Asia[1] -> Himalayas[363] -> Tibet (historical)[494]",E,NA,R,1,1,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,1,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,1,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,1,1,1,0,1,0,0,1,0,1,1,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,{01},1,0,0,1,1,0,1,1,1,0,1,1,1,0,1,1,0,1,0,1,0,1,1,1,0,1,0

An independent kingdom from the tenth century until 1834, Tibetan Buddhism remains the strongest religious influence, especially in the present-day district of Leh. From the 13th century onwards, Ladakhi kings upheld legitimacy through their roles as protectors of the Buddhist dharma, at one point annexing part of western Tibet; but, territorial acquisition was not sustainable. Political contact with Muslim neighbors increased from the 14th century onward through the 17th century when Mughal emperors asserted power over neighboring Kashmir. Following the Ladakh-Tibet-Mughal War 1679-1684, Ladhaki kings’ sustained religious allegiance to Tibetan Buddhism; meanwhile, Muslim populations increase coincided with the matrimonial union between the 17th century Buddhist king, ‘Jam-dbyang-rnam-rgyal, and the Muslim ruler of Baltistan’s daughter, RGyal Khatun. Following failed Portuguese Jesuit missionary efforts, British encounters increased only after 1834 when the armies of Zorawar Singh invaded. By 1842, Ladakh lost its independence to Dogra rule. Four years later, it fell under the state of Jammu-Kashmir which acknowledged the authority of British-India.

The organization was founded in 1926 by Hasyim Asyari in Surabaya, East Java, in response to the increasing presence of modernist Islam in the Dutch East Indies and the institutional force of Muhammadiyah, a modernist Islamic mass organization. The stated goal of the organization was to defend the interests and values of the scholars of traditionalist Sunni Islam, Ash'ari theology, and the Shafi'i school of jurisprudence. 
 

 Although the organization has a central leadership, there are many additional centers of authority underneath this top level, including provincial and regional branches and autonomous affiliated organizations for certain groups (e.g. women, youth, students). The beating heart of the organization is the network of traditionalist Islamic schools called (pesantren), where the future leaders and scholars of the organization are educated. Through the extensive pesantren network, the organization is able to reach and recruit constituents in a widely dispersed geographic area. The kyai or leaders of these pesantren are furthermore authoritative figures in their respective communities that exceeds the education of youth. 
 

 The organization has undergone multiple shifts in its almost century-long history. During the last years of Dutch colonial rule and the Japanese occupation (1942-45), Nahdlatul Ulama became politically active. After independence, Nahdlatul Ulama and the modernist Islamic mass organization Muhammadiyah worked together in a political party, Masyumi, representing the interests of Indonesian Muslims; but due to internal conflicts, Nahdlatul Ulama withdrew from Masyumi in 1952 and founded their own political party. The organization remained active in party politics until 1984. Since this time, it has not been directly involved in party politics. 
 

 Since the fall of the New Order in 1998, Nahdlatul Ulama has taken an active role in the formation in what they consider a tolerant, civil, and moderate Islam. In 1999, the renowned former chairman of Nahdlatul Ulama, Abdurrahman Wahid (more commonly known as Gus Dur) became the first democratically elected president of Reformation Era Indonesia. While his tenure as president was only two years long, his vision for the organization and the relation between the country and Islam continues to shape the organization until today. Gus Dur is held up as a hallmark of a friendly, accommodating, and tolerant Islam. Since 2015, this vision of a moderate Islam has become known within Nahdlatul Ulama as ‘Islam Nusantara,’ the Islam of the Indonesian world, a term which points to the organization’s commitment to embracing local culture, to coexisting peacefully with others, and to being an bulwark against radical Islamic influence.","Religious Group[8] -> Islamic Traditions[24], Religious Group[8], Religious Group[8] -> Southeast Asian Religions[808]",Verena Meyer,1053,Indonesia,"Nahdlatul Ulama was originally founded in Java and continues to draw many of its constituents from among the Javanese, but is present beyond Java across Indonesia.

2.1.1,971_ENR,971_ENR,971,"Elite, Religious Specialists, Non-elite (common people, general populace)",Gāṇapatya,Database of religion history (DRH),"The Gāṇapatya Sampradāya denotes a cluster of religious denominations whose worship and devotional systems are centered upon Gaṇeśa (Ganapati), the elephant-headed son of deities Śiva and Pārvatī. Members of the sampradāya are also referred to as Gāṇapatyas. Most modern Hindus regard Gaṇeśa as a god who helps petitioners overcome various kinds of obstacles. Reflecting this belief, he is usually invoked at the beginning of most formal pujas as a precautionary measure to ward off anticipated hindrances, hypothetical or otherwise. Gāṇapatyas expand this common Hindu position to interpret Gaṇeśa as the supreme manifestation of the supreme reality (brahman). 
 

 Although archaeological and scriptural evidence point to Ganesha's emergence as a recognizable deity in the first years of the common era, it is currently impossible to indicate a precise founding date for the Gāṇapatyas. Paul Courtright, the renowned American scholar of Ganesha, identifies the duration from the 6th to the 10th centuries CE as the likely time span of their early development. Some texts report that at least 6 different Gāṇapatya maṭhas (institutions) existed contemporaneously with those established by the theologian Śankara in the 9th century CE. Between the 6th to the 16th centuries CE, historians have noted the construction of dozens of temples across North, West and Southern India with Ganesha enshrined as the principal deity. Additionally, scholars of Hinduism have called attention to the composition of different Puranas and Tantras during the same period that describe the elaborate rituals and mythologies of textually-grounded communities that self-identify with the Gāṇapatya label. 
 

 While they appear to have died out as an independent sampradāya by the 17th century CE for reasons that will be illuminated in other sections of this entry, vestigial traces of Gāṇapatya-like practices continue to be observed in most forms of Indian religion. These practices are especially pronounced in Marathi-speaking areas. Courtright correlates the emergence of neo-Gāṇapatya movements in Maharashtra to political ascent of the Peshwas in the late 17th century. Appointed to serve as Prime Ministers at the court of the region's Maratha ruler, the Peshwas were largely derived from Chitpāvan Brahmin caste and worshipped  Ganesha as their clan deity (kuladevatā). They pioneered an elaborate display of the scripturally-prescribed, autumn Ganesh Chaturthi at their palace in Pune's Old City; these embellishments added amplified levels of grandeur to a festival that was hitherto observed as a domestic ritual at a simpler scale, subject to the discretion of individual families. These celebrations served to rekindle popular interest in temporarily-forgotten Gāṇapatya temples and the latter have since enjoyed a dramatic rise in patronage from Hindus of all sampradāyas. 
 

 In the 1890s, the Pune palace's Ganesh Chaturthi ceremony was re-engineered by freedom fighter and religious reformer Bal Gangadhar Tilak into a festival celebrated almost entirely in the public domain. In the ensuing decade, the popularity of Tilak's remodeled ritual inspired the creation of countless ""Ganpati mandals"" (Ganesha committees) across Maharashtra, all dedicated to the organization of a 10-day long puja in honor of Ganesha that attracted participants from across the spectrum of Maharastrian castes. Scholars of Marathi religion like GS Ghurye and Anne Feldhaus have remarked that the universalization of Ganesh Chaturthi has enabled nationalists to itemize neo-Ganapatya beliefs as a distinctive marker of a Hindu-Marathi identity that continues to be mobilized in opposition to region's other religious influences. 
 

 In more recent years, the Mumbai-based Bollywood film industry has frequently highlighted the worship of Ganesha, thereby motivating the reproduction of Ganesh Chaturthi festivals in other Indian states and in international cities that have large populations of Indian immigrants. All of these details notwithstanding, the residue of Ganapatya worship constitutes an essential aspect of modern Hinduism. A deeper investigation of this sampradaya reveals significant insights qua the nature of Indian religion at disparate historical moments.","Religious Group[8] -> Indic Religious Traditions[510] -> Hinduism[566] -> Modern Hinduism[646], Religious Group[8] -> Indic Religious Traditions[510] -> Hinduism[566] -> Smārta[647], Religious Group[8], Religious Group[8] -> Indic Religious Traditions[510] -> Hinduism[566], Religious Group[8] -> Indic Religious Traditions[510]",Aditya Bhattacharjee,1120,South India,South India (including Maharashtra),"India[463], India[498], India[498] -> Maharashtra[512]",E,N,R,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,1,0,1,1,0,1,0,1,1,0,1,1,0,1,1,0,1,1,0,1,0,0,1,0,1,0,1,1,1,1,1,1

It is also contended that the Meo converted to Islam after leaving other Hindu caste groups and a tribe, Meena, with whom they shared several similarities or that they were a nomadic Islamic tribe called the Mids, or Meds, who migrated from Western India into the region now known as Mewat, between the ninth and eleventh centuries. Today, perceived as converts from Hinduism, the Meo, numbering around 20 lakh, are considered low caste, or Neech zat, by the Indian Muslims. The Meo men and women are disfavoured for marriage by the Indian Muslims because of their suspect religious identity and their low caste status within the Muslim hierarchy.
 

 Till recently, they have considered themselves both as a caste group and a distinct religious faith within Islam because of this dual identity. During the colonial period, they were considered a distinct caste by both Hindus and Muslims. Their customs, traditions, life cycle ceremonies and modes of prayer, till the 1990s, closely replicated the Hindus with nominal adherence to Islamic practices like circumcision, nikah or marriage ceremony, and the burial. Though lauded for their syncretic culture and religious practises that adopted and adapted traditions from both religions without succumbing to the hard-core religiosity of either, they historically faced rejection from both the faiths because of their identification as neither a ‘true’ Muslim nor Hindu. 
 

 Historically, the Meo inhabited a geographically contiguous space called Mewat or the ‘land of the Meo’, understood more as a cultural space than an administrative unit.

Shamanic practices pre-date the arrival of Buddhism in the region which first became a state religion during the reign of Chinggis Khan’s grandson Khubilai Khan (r. 1260–1294). Shamanic practices and shamans have been the subject of religious oppression both by Buddhist institutions and more recently during the socialist period (1921-1990). Since the Democratic Revolution of 1989-1990, shamanism is once again allowed to be practiced in the public sphere. Since 1990 there has been a significant increase in the number of shamans and shamanic ceremonies in Mongolia. Shamanism in Mongolia differs from shamanism further north in Siberia due to the types of spirits that are channelled. Siberian shamans religious practices tend to be more animistic, channelling spirits as anthropologist Morten Pedersen puts it, ‘horizontally’. Mongolian shamans, on the other hand, channel ancestor spirits ‘vertically’. These are human spirits located within social hierarchies. Mongolian shamans typically communicate with an allied spirit or an ‘ongon’ who are the spirits of deceased human beings, generally within the shaman’s family. These spirits are historically located, reflecting specific genealogies. The presence of other spirits in the landscape is accepted by shamans, however it is not generally the focus of their ritual practice. Novice shamans are often found during shamanic ceremonies. Shamans can be recruited through extensive illnesses for which no cure can be found or other difficulties. Some men can become trapped in a semi-shamanic like state characterised by aggression and alcoholism which is known as ‘agsan’. Once a shaman establishes a relationship with an ongon they should carry out regular ceremonies and ritual offerings to maintain the relationship. Shamanic spirits don’t tend to provide eschatological or ontological answers, rather they provide advice for success in this life. Mongolian shamans enter a trance state without the use of drugs. They wear heavy clothing and a corded mask. Drumming and dancing is part of the trance state. Some shamans identify as yellow shamans as their practices include Buddhist elements.","Religious Group[8], Religious Group[8] -> Mongolian Religions[37], Religious Group[8] -> Shamanism[904]",Saskia AbrahmsKavunenko,1043,Contemporay Mongolia,"Contemporary Mongolia, sometimes referred to as 'Outer Mongolia' or 'Northern Mongolia'","Asia[1], Asia[1] -> East Asia[37], Asia[1] -> East Asia[37] -> Mongolia[210]",NA,N,R,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,1,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,1,1,0,1,0,0,1,0,1,0,1,1,0,1,1,1

While most Korean scholars, mass media, and public discourse apply mudang to both trance and non-trance practitioners, the terms mansin or kangsin-mu (god-descended mediators) more narrowly denote possessed practitioners. Sesŭp-mu are hereditary practitioners; they do not assert that gods descend into them and were not ordained after sinbyŏng (spirit possession sickness). This kind of initial possession serves as a demonstration that the practitioner was chosen by supernatural entities to be their mediators with people. The term mudang can be applied to both kinds of practitioners because before modern urbanization, regional traditions used to be the main factor that determined which kind of mudang will be common in each place. Although hereditary shamans are not possessed, they still engage with and talk to spirits. Sometimes, they harness the help of a spirit medium who can deliver messages from spirits and gods, although she cannot perform full kut rituals on her own. Furthermore, the dances and songs of this received cultural tradition are significant in terms of artistry because they are learned for many years, sometimes from a very young age. Their artistry has been acknowledged by the South Korean government designation program, as has been also the case with several possessed practitioners, or mansin. Mansin means “10,000 spirits” and refers to the polytheistic nature of this possession-based folk religion.","Religious Group[8], Religious Group[8] -> Shamanism[904], Religious Group[8] -> Animist[836], Religious Group[8] -> Korean Religions[28]",Liora Sarfati,717,South Korea,"South Korea

In 1936, before the violent religious purges of the late 1930s there were around 767 monasteries in Mongolia and somewhere between 75,000 and 100,000 lamas (robed monastics) in the country. By 1940 there were 251 lamas left in the country, an estimated 14,000 having been killed during the period. Following these purges of the late 1930s, religious activities of all kinds were severely restricted during the socialist period. Only one monastery, Gandantegchenlin Khiid was allowed to operate in Mongolia’s capital city, Ulaanbaatar. Due to active repression during the socialist period, most of the attendees of this temple were the elderly, particularly older women. In the winter of 1989-1990, Mongolia, dialoguing with broader democratic movements in the socialist world, had a Democratic Revolution. Following the revolution, religious freedoms were ensured and people once again began to practice religion in public. Since 1990, Buddhism has become one of the main religions in Mongolia, mostly following the Vajrayāna tradition. Although it shares many similarities with other Vajrayāna schools, in particular the Gelug and Nyingma lineages, Buddhism in Mongolia has unique characteristics that come from its local religious heritage, Mongolian beliefs systems and translocal organised religious groups, both Buddhist and non-Buddhist. Following the lifting of religious restrictions at the start of the democratic period, Mongolian lamas who had been lamas before the socialist purges once again donned robes and began to practice in public. These lamas reinhabited old temples and built new ones and began to take on new students. These lamas set about reinvigorating old traditions that had been kept alive in secret during the socialist period or remembered from their youth. At the same time as local practices were re-emerging, transnational Buddhist organisations (mostly from the Vajrayāna lineages) came to Mongolia to assist local efforts to re-establish Buddhism in the country. Many young novices were encouraged to go to India to study at monasteries connected to Tibetans in diaspora. Postsocialist Buddhist practice in Mongolia has also been characterized by the growth of other ritual practices and translocal religious traditions. These include local ritual practices, such as Mongolian shamanism, that have been gaining in popularity during the democratic period, and translocal religious traditions, such as Christianity and new religious movements. Buddhism in the contemporary period, as was the case in the presocialist period, has geopolitical significance. Its historical ties to Tibet and the Dalai Lama have been the source of geopolitical tensions with China. The relationships between Tibetans in diaspora and international organizations have internally affected Mongolian Buddhist hierarchies as well as lay Buddhist beliefs.","Religious Group[8], Religious Group[8] -> Mongolian Religions[37], Religious Group[8] -> Buddhist Traditions[14]",Saskia AbrahmsKavunenko,1032,Mongolia,"Contemporary Mongolia, sometimes referred to as 'Outer Mongolia' or 'Northern Mongolia'","Asia[1], North Asia[441]",E,N,R,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,1,0,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,1,1,1,0,0,0,1,0,1,1,0,1,0,0,1,0,1,1,1,1,0,0,1,1

He was one of the first emissaries of Hinduism in America. In 1965, the Immigration and Naturalization Act allowed for increased immigration from all regions of India to the US. These immigrants were mostly skilled workers, particularly in areas related to technology and medicine. This ushered in an era of temple building. Also at this time, there were many Indian gurus who began movements in the United States, gathering followers and espousing wisdom. These gurus brought yoga with them and what was originally a Hindu meditative practice often became separated from its origins in its American context. Finally, these immigrants started families and now there are many Hindu-Americans who were born and raised in the United States. Temples continued to grow as community centers in part to educate this new generation of Hindus. This is different from how Hindu temples function in India. 
 

 Hindus in America are people of both Indian and non-Indian origin who practice Hinduism in its American diasporic context, where there is no overarching governing structure, but where ""Hinduism"" as a whole becomes more codified, regardless of regional or sectarian differences, in part due to its contrast with other religious groups. Hinduism in this context is often referred to as ecumenical.","Religious Group[8], Religious Group[8] -> Indic Religious Traditions[510] -> Hinduism[566] -> Diaspora[844], Religious Group[8] -> Indic Religious Traditions[510], Religious Group[8] -> Indic Religious Traditions[510] -> Hinduism[566]",Rita Biagioli,856,United States,blah,United States[366],NA,N,NA,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,1,1,1,0,0,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,{01},0,{01},1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,1,0,{01},1,1,0,0,0,1,0,1,1,0,1,0,0,1,0,1,0,1,1,1,0,1,1

After experiencing a spiritual vision of a heavenly realm during a solar eclipse on New Years Day of 1889, Wilson began to travel and preach a message of universal love and nonviolence to Indians across the present-day Western United States. Wilson was a spiritual leader among the Northern Paiute (a people who inhabited present-day Nevada) and commonly referred to as ""Wovoka."" This entry focuses on the practice and religion of the Ghost Dance, but especially on how Wovoka's movement took hold among the Lakota Sioux near the turn of the 20th century. Most historians accept that the persistent practice of the Ghost Dance by the Lakota as one of the most significant factors which lead the US military to attack and murder hundreds of non-combatant Lakota people at Wounded Knee Creek in South Dakota in the late December of 1890. This event, until relatively recently, was known as the ""Battle of Wounded Knee."" However, there has been a push in the field to call it what it was: The Wounded Knee Massacre.
 

 The Ghost Dance itself consists of a traditional circle dance, where many of the participants fell into ecstatic trances and chants. While the ecstatic states and mix-gendered dancing that the ritual entailed grated puritan sensibilities, what made the ceremony threatening to US citizens and military leaders was the ideology and beliefs that lay at the foundations of the dance. Wovoka, as did many spiritual leaders before him of the Paiute, prophesied the return of the dead and the overturning of the current hegemonic [white] order. When the dead returned, they would expel the whites from the land, and traditional indigenous ways of life would return. Death and sickness would cease to exist, and all would reunite with their beloved dead. The Ghost Dance ritual itself was performed to hasten this return of the dead and the overthrowing of oppressive white settlers. Lakota Sioux especially emphasized the upheaval and transformation of the current order in their practice of the religion. Thus, it is easy to see why the method was disconcerting to white onlookers. 
 

 However, critical to the coming of the dead was the strict adherence to a Christian-like moral code and an unwavering commitment to nonviolence. Wovoka forbade war between tribes and between Indians and the white man. He preached, especially against the practice of rituals which required self-mutilation, warned against lying and stealing, and encouraged all indigenous followers of his Ghost Dance Religion to work hard and earn money through the established systems of the emerging industrial economy. Therefore, while the Ghost Dance Religion was indeed apocalyptic, most scholars believe it primarily functioned to integrate indigenous people into modern society for the sake of Native survival. The thought goes that Wovoka was trying to ensure indigenous flourishing while providing something like a societal pressure valve and release through the apocalyptic hope and practice of the Ghost Dance.","Religious Group[8], Religious Group[8] -> Native American (North American) Religions[38] -> Lakota Religious Traditions[863] -> The Ghost Dance[1008], Religious Group[8] -> Native American (North American) Religions[38], Religious Group[8] -> Native American (North American) Religions[38] -> Lakota Religious Traditions[863]",James Waters,1075,Lakota Sioux Reservations as of 1890,"From 1868 to 1889, there were several acts and agreements that significantly reduced the land ceded to the Lakota Sioux.

2.1.1,940_EN,940_EN,940,"Elite, Non-elite (common people, general populace)",Julio-Claudian Imperial Cult,Database of religion history (DRH),"The term ‘imperial cult’ refers to the worship of the emperor and imperial family throughout the Roman Empire. Two factors make classifying and clarifying the practice of imperial cult difficult. First, religion was not separate from the political and secular sphere at Rome; as such it is difficult to determine whether the imperial involvement in religious practice was primarily driven by religious impulses as opposed to political motives. Second, because of the diversity of the Roman Empire, there is no unity to the practices of emperor worship. (In general, we distinguish between cultic observance in the Eastern empire, Western empire, and at Rome.) Bearing these two factors in mind, the following is an attempt to chart the beginnings of imperial cult under the Julio-Claudian emperors. 
 

 The Augustan principate marked the transition between Republican and Imperial forms of government. However, the regime operated on the premise that Augustus, who was, post-Actium, simply an ordinary Roman citizen, restored the Republic. This façade made the operations of the cult especially problematic and the imperial household was deliberately obscure in the language it used to describe cultic activity (cf. Rives: 2007). Augustus himself was the son of a god: Julius Caesar had been divinised. Caesar’s career proved a beneficial model for articulating imperial divinity. Augustus used his divine genealogy to create an aura of specialness around himself; but he was equally aware that Caesar’s regal and divine posturing had contributed to sending him to an early grave. For more on Caesar and the cult see Weinstock: 1971.
 

 Most scholars understand the worship of the emperor in the eastern provinces as a continuation of the customary practice of ruler-cult (cf. Cerfaux and Tondriau: 1957; Fears in Grant and Kitzinger ed. 1988; Klauck: 2003; Taylor: 1979). Augustus would not be unprecedented in this. Roman officials had received divine honours in eastern cities before (e.g. Marcus Claudius Marcellus in Syracuse from 212BC onwards); however, these examples are confined to single cities. Thus, a development came in 29 BC when temples to Augustus and the goddess Roma were granted to provinces in Asia and Bythinia-Pontus. However, the acceptance of these temples can be interpreted as an established method of assimilating Roman rule with the practices of the region.
 

 Provinces requested the emperor’s permission before building temples to him and there are many examples of requests denied. It was common early on for the emperor to be associated with the goddess Roma as a way of softening the claim to divinity. In 15BC Hispania Tarraconensis gained permission for a temple to Augustus and Rome (cf. Fishwick: 2014) and in 12BC three provinces of Gaul established an altar to Augustus at Lugdunum (Livy, Epit. 139). These examples set a precedent for one way we can understand imperial cult. In general it was used to create cohesion and unity throughout the empire (cf. Gordon in Beard and North ed. 1990). Cult practice brought neighbouring communities together in acts of worship; it also cemented their relationship with Rome. As such imperial cult was a tool for empire building. 
 

 The situation at Rome is even more complex; asking freeborn citizens to worship the emperor, however obliquely, was a delicate process (cf. Price in Bowman, Champlin & Lintott ed. 1996). In 7BC Augustus had reorganised the cults of the 265 districts (‘vici’) of the city; henceforth officials worshiped the Augustan Lares and the emperor’s ‘genius’ at these shrines. Every Roman had a ‘genius’ and the worship of a paterfamilias’ ‘genius’ is attested; these shrines, therefore, might be more aimed at treating the emperor as a father figure. Indeed, Augustus was eventually granted the title ‘father of his country’ (‘pater patriae’). Moreover, it seems these shrines were primarily overseen by freedmen and so worship at them was directed not at the political elite. There is also evidence that Augustus’ ‘genius’ was worshipped in private households; again this could be understood as part of envisioning the emperor as a paternal figure and assimilating veneration of him with traditional ancestor worship. For more on these issues see Scheid in Belayche ed. 2001 & Lipka: 2006.
 

 After Augustus’ death in 14AD, the emperor Tiberius was equally guarded in his attitude to cult activities. Augustus was deified after death (as Caesar had been before him). This entitled Tiberius to also style himself a divi filius (son of a god). The key policy was to provide all due honour and respect to Augustus (Tacitus, Ann. 1.15; cf. Cowan: 2009). For living members of the imperial family, and the emperor himself, the situation was more difficult. Tiberius was selective in what honours he would receive and where he would have temples built. For example, though Tiberius accepted a temple to himself (together with the senate and Livia) in Asia, he refused one in Spain; his reason was, apparently, a desire to follow Augustan precedent in accepting some honours, but not to cheapen Augustus’ divinity by allowing widespread sycophantic worship of the current emperor to eclipse reverence for his divinised predecessor (Tacitus, Ann. 4.37). As with Augustus, the cult was still primarily located in the East, and worship of the living emperor was combined with an abstract divinity that signified allegiance to Rome (in this case the senate). It is telling, however, that Tiberius’ mother Livia was now also involved. We are gradually moving towards a situation where a family, and not exceptional individuals, are being marked out as super-human. 
 

 Cultic practice took on a new complexion with Gaius Caligula’s ascension to the principate (37AD). A young man with apparent mental problems, Caligula marks a turn in the imperial government because he was the first emperor to ‘inherit’ based on family ties alone. Both Tiberius and Augustus had been great statesmen in their own right; at 25, Caligula had had little experience in government and military affairs. He seems to have been influenced by ideas of Hellenic ruler-cult, and perhaps even Egyptian notions of imperial divinity; sources record that he replaced the heads of the statues of the gods with his own image and sat between the Dioscuri in their temple to be worshipped with them. There is even serious suggestion that he set up his own temple in Rome with priests and a golden cult image of himself (Suetonius, Calig 22; Claud. 9; Dio 59.28.6; cf. Bilde: 1978). Imperial women also gained in influence: Caligula’s sisters appeared on coins associated with the goddesses Securitas, Fortuna, and Concordia (cf. Wood: 1995). When his sister Drusilla died in 38AD she became the first imperial female to be deified (Dio 59.11). Though accusations of madness and incest make for entertaining anecdotes in our sources, it is hard not to see an attempt on Caligula’s part to use Hellenic and Egyptian models of ruler-cult to secure his own imperial position. If he had come to power on the basis of his family, it might be beneficial to emphasise the exceptionality of his breeding. The experiment failed, however, and Caligula was assassinated in 41AD.  
 

 Under Claudius, the penultimate Julio-Claudian emperor, we see further evolution of imperial cult practice. Governing after Caligula’s murder in 41AD, Claudius was significantly more cautious than his nephew in all areas. He appears to have reverted to Tiberius’ practice of bolstering the dead and deified and taking the spotlight off himself. This also helped raise the prestige of the family at the same time and under him Livia, the wife of Augustus, was deified (Suetonius, Claud. 11).  
 

 After his conquest of Britain, Claudius agreed to a massive temple complex to himself at Camulodunum in the province (Tacitus, Ann. 14.31). Britain was a troublesome province and the use of the cult centred around the emperor’s person indicates the way in which the religion aimed to foster unity and adherence to the empire. There is no evidence that Claudius shared this temple with another divinity (cf. Fishwick: 1961): if this is so, it marks a crucial turning point in imperial worship, where the emperor and empire are being collapsed into the same idea. However, in a move similar to Tiberius, Claudius rejected a surfeit of temples. In a surviving letter to the Alexandrians he declines, and expresses his distaste for, a purported temple to himself (despite having such a temple in Britain already). The letter illustrates the difficulties in defining imperial cult practices throughout the empire. However, the information we have implies that successful emperors were cautious in their approach growing the cult slowly and never indulging in excessive honours for themselves.
 

 Imperial cult was a useful weapon for growing allegiance to the empire and imperial family as the provinces expanded and the Julio-Claudian family attempted to retain power. However, it was a double-edged sword: too much self-aggrandisement could pave the way for ridicule and sedition. Thus, though the cult is slippery to pin down it is a fascinating index of the development of imperial power and growth in the period.","Religious Group[8] -> Syro-Palestinian Religion[930], Religious Group[8] -> Roman Religions[900], Religious Group[8] -> Hellenistic Religions[741], Religious Group[8], Religious Group[8] -> Persian Religions[41], Religious Group[8] -> Roman Religious Traditions[42], Religious Group[8] -> Rome[974], Religious Group[8] -> Italic Religions[751], Religious Group[8] -> Carthage[976], Religious Group[8] -> Phrygia[978], Religious Group[8] -> Egyptian Religions[20], Religious Group[8] -> Greek Cult[982]",Treasa Bell,132,Roman Empire (Greatest Extent),"Most of Western Europe and the Mediterranean, but tagged only as ""Western Europe"".","Europe[3], Europe[3] -> Western Europe[296]",E,N,NA,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,1,0,1,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,1,0,1,1,0,0,1,1

Approximately 150,000 Ethiopian Jews currently reside within Israel. 5,000 Ethiopian Jews remain in Northwest Ethiopia where they have waited over 20 years to migrate to Israel. Those who migrated to Israel during the aliyah have settled in a variety of cities within modern Israel where they have continued to maintain their ritual practices and cultivate new religious traditions and beliefs. Separated from Ashkenazi, Sephardic, and Mizrahi Jewish communities, Ethiopian Jews have cultivated their own ritual traditions, including dance, music, ideas about the Sabbath, and the practice of legal interpretation. In particular, debates and questions about Ethiopian Jews' knowledge of the Talmud or Oral Torah of Judaism persist with Israel's chief religious institution, the Rabbinate, refusing to categorize Ethiopian Jewish authorities, known as the kesim, as rabbis due to their perceived lack of knowledge of the Oral Torah. However, in 2018 the Israeli government formally recognized the kesim as the religious leaders of Ethiopian Jews and promised to put twenty kesim on the government payroll. Formal recognition of the kesim always involved instituted a government committee over the kesim which would supervise and regulate their activities. Some have criticized this attempt to formally recognize the kesim and argued that it will cause more problems and issues with the government now given the right and ability to survey and regulate Ethiopian Jewish authorities. As a result of these ongoing political complexities over the status of Ethiopian Jews, their legal status as Jews has and continues to be increasingly called into questioned and debated. In recent years, Ethiopian Jews living in Israeli cities have increasingly confronted social, economic, and political discrimination in the country which have led to widespread national protests and confrontations with authorities. While discrimination and marginalization remain persistent issues, Ethiopian Jews have increasingly integrated into Israeli institutions, including Israel's leading hi-technology companies, social services, and government agencies, with the first Ethiopian Jewish woman elected to a ministry position in May of 2020.","Religious Group[8], Religious Group[8] -> African Religions[9], Religious Group[8] -> Jewish Traditions[27]",Amanda Furiasse,1104,israel,Ethiopian Jews after the Aliyah from Ethiopia,Middle East[5],E,N,R,1,1,0,0,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,0,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,0,1,0,0,1,1,1,0,0,0,1,1,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,1,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,1,0,1,1,0,1,0,0,1,0,1,1,1,1,0,0,1,0
2.1.1,848_ER,848_ER,848,"Elite, Religious Specialists",Sadducees,Database of religion history (DRH),"One of the three primary sects in Second Temple Judaism (alongside the Pharisees and Essenes). The Sadducees are primarily known as being comprised of the social elites, many of whom were part of the priestly society of Jerusalem. The Sadducees that fit this description were heavily involved in political and religious affairs, including the oversight of the temple. Sadducees, however, were also found outside of Jerusalem in the region of ancient Palestine and included Jews of every social class. The only known shared belief among all Sadducees is the determination for a return of the priestly dynasty. The Sadducee's demise is frequently tied to the destruction of the Jerusalem temple by the Romans in 70 CE, though it is likely that Jews continued to identify with the group even after this event.
 The name Sadducee and the origins of the movement are still cloaked in uncertainty. Scholars believe that linguistically the name Sadducee is derived from one of two Hebrew origins. While some propose that the term is related to the Hebrew term tzaddik (“righteous”) and provides context to the movements beliefs, others connect the term to the figure Zadok, the high priest in the days of David and Solomon and argue that the group is in some way connected to a priestly lineage. Although these explanations have been held up as insights into the origins of the Jewish sect and have been used to hint at the early history of the group, there is not enough primary information available to know for certain if there is any tie between the name and the movement’s history. References to Sadducees first appear in the literature of the Hasmonaean period, but there is no definitive history of the sect, though some posit that the elitism of the sect has its origins in earlier periods.
 Many of the perceived insights into the Sadducees (close connection with outside rulers, highly Hellenized, etc.) stem from equating elitism with various aspects of culture and society in the late Second Temple period. These conclusions, however, are largely erroneous as the primary source material describing the Sadducees is very limited. Most of the information about the Sadducees aligns with the beliefs and practices of Second Temple Judaism, while distinctive characteristics are derived from what is said about them in the Greek New Testament and what is preserved in the writings of Josephus. Later Christian commentators rely exclusively upon these sources in their discussions of the Jewish sect. Additional information can be gleaned from Tannaitic references that highlight arguments between the tsadukim (likely the Sadducees) and perushim (likely the Pharisees). Ultimately, we have to be cautious and follow the statement of Lawrence Schiffman who stated, ""the views of the Pharisees and Sadducees must remain shrouded in mystery.""","Religious Group[8], Religious Group[8] -> Jewish Traditions[27], Religious Group[8] -> Jewish Traditions[27] -> Late Second Temple Judaism[743]",Joshua Matson,485,Roman Palestine,Roman Palestine,"Asia[1] -> Western Asia[232] -> Israel[239], Asia[1] -> Western Asia[232] -> State of Palestine[246], Middle East[5]",E,NA,R,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,1,0,1,1,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,1,1,1,0,1,1,1,0,0,0
2.1.2,893_ENR,893_ENR,893,"Elite, Religious Specialists, Non-elite (common people, general populace)",Sethian Gnostic,Database of religion history (DRH),"Sethian gnostics – also referred to by scholars as “classic gnostics” or simply “the gnostics” – represent a sect within early Christianity that existed from the second through the fourth century CE. Most of what we know about this group derives from the discovery of the Nag Hammadi collection of Coptic manuscripts, which dates to around 350 CE, but this information is supplemented by various heresiological writings by early proto-orthodox theologians, most significantly Irenaeus, who wrote around 180 CE. The name Sethian is applied to the sect by modern scholars because of its self-identification with the biblical Seth, son of Adam. “Gnostics” comes from the Greek word gnōstikoi (roughly, “those who know”), which some scholars consider to be a label the Sethians applied to themselves.
 

 Social information about the Sethians must be inferred from the textual evidence, which contains a number of features used to characterize them: (1) a complex cosmogonic myth based in part on a creative revision of Genesis and Plato’s Timaeus, (2) a strong sense of group identity and in-group language as the “seed (or offspring) of Seth,” and (3) a ritual of baptism sometimes called a ritual of “five seals.” Very little is known of the daily life or organizational structure of the Sethians. They shared with other Christians certain theological traditions, some scripture, and an ascetic lifestyle.
 

 Some features of the Sethian myth include: (1) an ineffable divine first principle called the Parent or Invisible Spirit; (2) a second principle called Barbelo; (3) a series of four luminaries, also called aeons or realms, named Harmozel, Oroiael, Daveithai, and Eleleth; (4) the emanation of a number of additional aeons, the last of which is named Wisdom (Sophia in Greek); (5) a craftsman (dēmiourgos in Greek) named Ialdabaoth, who steals divine power from his mother (Wisdom) to create the visible cosmos based on intelligible paradigms while remaining ignorant of the divinities higher than him; (6) the creation of seven, twelve, and/or 365 rulers of the material world who themselves create human beings and the remainder of the material world; (7) a dramatic struggle resulting in some of humanity being given Ialdabaoth’s pilfered power as a spark of divinity; (8) these human beings are the offspring of Seth, sealed by a special baptismal ritual, while the offspring of Cain remain under the power of the ignorant demiurge and his minions. (9) Where the human Jesus appears in the versions of this myth, he is variously identified with a preexistent Anointed One (Greek christos), a preexistent Word (Greek logos), a preexistent Seth, or Barbelo.
 Individual Sethian texts contain some but not all of the elements of this myth. As such, the category “Sethian Gnostic” can be understood as a polythetic class, i.e. it contains a number of non-essential characteristics but lacks an essential (sine qua non) characteristic. Some scholars, notably John D. Turner, have reconstructed a “literary history” of these texts based on textual developments within this mythic framework. The complex emanation scheme of the Sethian myth reveals an involvement with the Middle Platonic philosophical speculation of the time, which has been compared to such thinkers as Philo of Alexandria and Numenius of Apamea.","Religious Group[8] -> Roman Religions[900], Religious Group[8] -> Abrahamic[905], Religious Group[8] -> Christian Traditions[18], Religious Group[8] -> Christian Traditions[18] -> Early Christianity[742], Religious Group[8] -> Heresy[854], Religious Group[8]",Brian Alt,1048,"Alexandria and the Nile, Rome, Antioch and environs, etc.","Regions are based on Bentley Layton, The Gnostic Scriptures (1987) pp. 10-11.","Europe[3], Europe[3] -> Southern Europe[73], Europe[3] -> Southern Europe[73] -> Italy[288], Africa[14], Africa[14] -> Northern Africa[64], Africa[14] -> Northern Africa[64] -> Egypt[116], Europe[3] -> Southern Europe[73] -> Italy[288] -> Rome[376], Eastern Mediterranean[447]",E,N,R,1,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,0,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,0,1,0,0,1,0,1,0,1,1,1,1,0,0

They follow the system of beliefs (also named Ilm-e-Khshnoom) introduced by Behramshah Naoroji Shroff (1858-1927) at the beginning of the 20th century. Shroff’s teachings are based upon an esoteric interpretation of the Avesta, which is the collection of sacred Zoroastrian scriptures. Ilm-e-Khshnoom emerged from colonial India, when the Westernisation process exposed the religious vulnerability of the Parsi community. The teachings of Shroff are based on a set of universal laws of nature that span from the idea of reincarnation to that of the vibrational power dwelling in the practice of Zoroastrian rituals. Shroff, a Parsi himself, claimed to have been initiated to Ilm-e-Khshnoom by the Sāheb Delān 'Master-Hearts', a secluded community of Zoroastrian spiritual masters in Mount Damāvand, Iran. During his stay, he allegedly acquired abilities like telepathy and divination techniques such as astrology. The Parsis who follow Ilm-e-Khshnoom nowadays are a small minority of the approximatively 50,000 Zoroastrians who live in India, mainly in Mumbai and in some cities of the state of Gujarat. There are not exclusion or inclusion criteria for the membership of this religious group other than being born from a Zoroastrian family. Nevertheless, ethnocentrism characterises not only the adherents of Ilm-e-Khshnoom but a large part of the Parsi community, in contrast to another part of the community which promote religious reformism and conversions. Furthermore, the transmission of Ilm-e-Khshnoom across generations has occurred through the familiar nucleus. In effect, families continue to exert a durable impact on the religious canons as well as on the communal ideology and responsibility of Parsis. The followers of Ilm-e-Khshnoom emphasise a strict observance of the Zoroastrian rituals and adopt particular principles in the ritual practice. These principles remark the importance of addressing precise thoughts while reciting a given portion of the Avesta correctly accompanied by a specific kinetic motion. They also represent distinctive elements of contradistinction of the followers of Ilm-e-Khshnoom against the wider Parsi community. Another distinctive element is the adoption of the liturgical calendar. While the Shenshai is the most widespread calendar among the Zoroastrians of India, the adherents of Ilm-e-Khshnoom advocate the adoption of the Fasli calendar. From the 1980’s, Parsis who follow the teachings of Shroff can be found in US and Canada as well as in Australia.","Religious Group[8], Religious Group[8] -> Zoroastrianism[49], Religious Group[8] -> Zoroastrianism[49] -> Parsis (India)[295]",Mariano Errichiello,1027,Parsis in India,"Currently, the largest communities of Parsis are in the states of Maharashtra (mainly Mumbai and Pune) and Gujarat (mainly Ahmedabad, Navsari, Surat, Udvada and Vadodara).","Asia[1], Asia[1] -> South Asia[40], Asia[1] -> South Asia[40] -> India[215], Asia[1] -> South Asia[40] -> India[215] -> Gujarat[347]",NA,N,R,1,1,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,1,0,1,1,0,1,0,0,1,0,1,0,1,1,0,1,0,0
2.1.2,986_ER,986_ER,986,"Elite, Religious Specialists",Theurgy,Database of religion history (DRH),"Theurgy in late antiquity combined Platonic philosophy with the indigenous ritual practices of the Roman Empire (sacrifice, divination, etc.). Although theurgy first appeared in the so-called Chaldean Oracles of the second century CE, the most important surviving statement of theurgic theory and practice is the treatise ""On the Mysteries"" (De mysteriis) of the Neoplatonic philosopher Iamblichus (c. 240 – c. 325 CE). Scholars generally understand Neoplatonism beginning with Iamblichus to represent a break with the earlier thought of Plotinus (205 – 270 CE) due to its reliance on ritual as a means of salvation for the soul. After Iamblichus, the most important expositor of theurgic Neoplatonism was Proclus (412 – 485 CE), whose ideas directly influenced the Christian liturgy of pseudo-Dionysius. The word theurgy combines two Greek roots, theos (god) and ourgos (work). As ""divine work,"" theurgy is understood to be a cooperative endeavor between the gods and human beings, in which the latter use divinely inspired ritual to increase their fitness for divine influence. Informed by centuries of Platonic thinking about individual and cosmic bodies, theurgy maps the parts of the self (microcosm) onto the parts of the universe (macrocosm), allowing one to enact rituals in order to purify or empower the parts of the self through an understanding of cosmic sympathy. Theurgic ritual, according to Iamblichus and Proclus, interacts with the various parts of the highly stratified divine cosmos, which is itself envisioned (following Plato’s Timaeus 30d-31a) as a single living being encompassing all other beings. The metaphor of a living cosmos provides the basis for the doctrine of cosmic sympathy (sumpatheia) and its transcendent cause, divine love (theia philia), which provides cohesion for the universe (macrocosm) as well as for the individual soul (microcosm). The sympathy between the soul, the universe, and the gods allows the theurgist to employ ""signatures"" (sumbola, sunthēmata) consisting of natural materials (e.g. stones, plants, incense), divine names, and mental constructs in order to achieve his or her goals. The goals of theurgy are consistent with those of Platonic philosophy – becoming like god (ὁμοίωσις θεῷ: Plato’s Theaetetus 176b) – as a lifelong practice producing a ""cumulative contact, assimilation, and, ultimately, union with the divine and thereby the divinization of the theurgist"" (Addey 2014: 25). A cosmic hierarchy of beings, thought forms, and ritual objects informed this lifelong practice and may have made theurgy difficult to distinguish from magic for the casual observer. In fact, the principles of theurgic ritual were very close to Plotinus’s account of how magic (mageia, goēteia) functioned through cosmic sympathy (Ennead 4.4.40). However, theurgy was distinct from ancient magic in at least two ways: (1) The aims of theurgy were different. Whereas magicians might think to coerce the gods for their own worldly ends, theurgists (and all Platonists) understood the gods to be immutable, so they instead focused on enhancing their own fitness for assimilating divine power, which was a gift from the gods. (2) Although cosmic sympathy in its popular form may have functioned ""horizontally"" in the material world only, for theurgists sympathy as an expression of divine love (theia philia) always had a vertical component: objects in the material world derived their potency from divine powers by corresponding to a certain ""chain"" (seira) of influence, such as a planet or another astrological category.","Religious Group[8] -> Hellenistic Religions[741], Religious Group[8] -> Syncretic Religions[806], Religious Group[8], Religious Group[8] -> Greek Religions[22] -> Greek Philosophical Traditions[746], Religious Group[8] -> Roman Religious Traditions[42], Religious Group[8] -> Rome[974], Religious Group[8] -> Greek Religions[22], Religious Group[8] -> Roman Religious Traditions[42] -> Egyptian Religions[732], Religious Group[8] -> Roman Religious Traditions[42] -> Greek Religions in Rome[733]",Brian Alt,1144,Known Theurgic Neoplatonic Schools,"Large cities with known Neoplatonic philosophical schools, including (but not limited to) Rome, Athens, Alexandria, Thebes (Egypt), Antioch (and Apamea).","Africa[14] -> Northern Africa[64], Asia[1], Levant[461], Africa[14], Asia Minor[434], Italy[531], Africa[14] -> Northern Africa[64] -> Egypt[116], Greece[500], Syria[406], Italy[531] -> Rome[532], Asia[1] -> Anatolia[344], Levant[461] -> Mediterranean Coast[506]",E,NA,R,1,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,0,0,1,1,0,1,1,0,1,0,0,1,0,1,0,1,1,1,1,0,0

These two college students, Lance Christie and Tim Zell (who now goes by Oberon Zell-Ravenheart), looked at this religion and thought “it was fiction so good is should be true,” and thus they engaged in the most holy of Martian traditions, water sharing. 
 

 By 1963 they had officially started the Church of All Worlds. Over the following five decades the group grew to have major influence on alternative religion in America. Adding to their science fiction roots they adopted aspects of the growing environmental movement, western esoterism, and human potential psychology. They found themselves at the center of a number of the social movements that the 1960s and 70s have become famous for. They coined the term polyamory. They were one of the first (or the first according to some sources) group to refer to themselves proudly as “pagan.”. They helped develop many of the rituals and traditions that would become the Neo-Pagan tradition. They fought a battle with the IRS to become one of the first tax-exempt organizations to identify as part of this tradition. They published the “Green Egg,” one of the most important Neo-Pagan magazines. The founders even raised living unicorns at one point. 
 

 The Church has also experienced many ups and downs. At its height in the late 90s, they numbered around 1200 due paying members, with many more coming their festivals, engaging in their rituals, and working alongside them in both their magazine, a number of store front locations and at ANNWN, their sacred land in Northern California. The Church still exists today though its membership is much smaller, with less than a hundred due paying members in the United States. Still, the group continues to attract new adherents, its founder, Oberon Zell, maintains a busy schedule of speaking engagements and writing projects. In 2004 Zell opened the Grey School of Wizardry, an online magick school self-consciously based on Hogwarts, from the Harry Potter novels. Showing that many still keep their science fiction roots close, remaining invested in a sense of play, creativity, and a keen eye for popular culture.","Religious Group[8] -> Celtic Polytheism[959] -> Celtic Neo-Paganism[1024], Religious Group[8] -> New Religious Movement (NRM)[834] -> Magick Tradition[1025], Religious Group[8] -> New Religious Movement (NRM)[834], Religious Group[8] -> New Religious Movement (NRM)[834] -> Neo-Paganism[1026], Religious Group[8] -> New Religious Movement (NRM)[834] -> Invented Religion[1027], Religious Group[8] -> Hellenistic Religions[741], Religious Group[8] -> North American Religions[998], Religious Group[8], Religious Group[8] -> Pantheistic[815], Religious Group[8] -> Hellenistic Religions[741] -> Hellenistic Neo-Paganism[1023], Religious Group[8] -> Celtic Polytheism[959]",Damian LanahanKalish,1096,The United States (primarily the west coast and the midwest) as well as Australia,"Although the Church has members all over the world most of its activity has been in California, the St. Louis area, and Australia.","Oceania[13], Oceania[13] -> Australia[75], United States[366], United States[366] -> Lower 48[400], United States[366] -> California[495]",NA,N,R,1,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,0,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,1,0,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,0,0,1,1,1,1,0,1,0,0,1,0,1,0,1,1,0,0,0,0

Some key features of Tamil neo-Saiva thought and practice include a frequent theological and scholastic focus on autonomous, ""Dravidian"" Tamil cultural identity and history relative to Brahmanical, Sanskritic, ""Aryan"" Hinduism; an explicitly monotheistic theology centered on the Hindu god Siva (Tamil civaṉ, Sanskrit Śiva; spelled Siva in this entry in deference to English-language neo-Saiva spelling conventions); and a particular connection with the Vellala caste community, a non-Brahmin Tamil caste community especially culturally influential and prestigious in pre-colonial Tamil society. Key to the intellectual development of neo-Saivism was the efflorescence of Tamil literary and historical scholarship associated with the Tamil Renaissance of the closing decades of the 19th century. Vellala Neo-Saiva scholars were at the forefront of historical scholarship that sought to investigate the culture, history, and social norms of an indigenous, pre-Sanskritic Tamil civilization, and the ""rediscovery"" of a wide range of ancient Tamil literature in the latter half of the 19th century offered a rich body of evidence for both theological and scholastic arguments about Tamil cultural identity. In opposition to the Sanskritic Brahmanical Hindu tradition, which attained an unprecedented degree of political and social influence in the Tamil country under British colonial rule, Tamil neo-Saivism eschews Sanskrit-language religious literature and Vedantic theology, instead recognizing a canon of Tamil-language texts and hymns including classical Tamil poetic literature from the Sangam period, the Saivite Tamil bhakti poetry of the Nāyaṉār poet-saints (6th-8th CE), and a variety of Tamil-language tantric and agamic texts with ties to non-Brahmin Tamil temple worship practices. Reversing the claims of Brahmanical Hinduism, Tamil neo-Saivism asserts that the worship of Siva is native to pre-Sanskritic Tamil civilization, and the Brahmanical tradition is a subsequent corruption of originally Tamil religious teachings. A resulting priority in neo-Saiva theology and scholarship is the re-establishment of putatively original Tamil religious, social, and cultural mores, a project through which religious ideas became linked to a distinct cultural politics. Notable Tamil neo-Saiva luminaries include Somasundara Nayakar (1846-1901), P.

2.1.2,846_E,846_E,846,Elite,Xuanzang's Yogācāra Tradition,Database of religion history (DRH),"This entry is aimed to document the religious beliefs and activities of Xuanzang and his major dharma heirs. Xuanzang (intentionally or subconsciously) established the ""Yogācāra"" tradition, which he deemed as the genuine form of Mahāyāna Buddhism, in China. 
 

 Xuanzang is one of the most famous pilgrims in world history who took an arduous journey to India, studied at the Nalanda Monastery, and introduced thousands of Buddhist scriptures to China. After returning from India, Xuanzang accompanied the Emperor Taizong of Tang for a period of time. Later, with the royal patronage, he initiated mass translation projects and thus also renowned as one of the “Four Greatest Chinese Buddhist translators.”
 

 Within his translation teams, a few members became his intimate disciples, e.g. Kuiji, Woncheuk and Puguang. They carried and developed Xuanzang’s teaching and wrote many commentaries to explain this sophisticated scholastic Buddhist tradition. As a request received from Kuiji, Xuanzang, based on the works of the ten greatest Yogācāra commentators at the Nalanda Monastery, manufactured the classic compendium Cheng weishi lun, which later became the most seminal text not only for the whole Yogācāra tradition but also for the whole Chinese Buddhism tradition. 
 

 Despite its particularity, this tradition is far from institutionalized and only bonded by their doctrinal proclivities. Societally speaking, this tradition did not last more than a century. Its cradle place, the Great Ci’en Temple, soon became Tantric-focused. The tradition neither has a patriarchal system by itself nor provide a clear dharma-transmission narrative. After two generations, the number of commentaries gradually diminished. Since then, this strand of Yogācāra thoughts is fully dismantled into Chinese Buddhist traditions, such as Chan and Huayan. Along with four major and minor transmission, this tradition is transmitted into Japan and became fully sectarianized as the Hossō sect, which remained as one of the strongest Buddhist sects in Japan.
  
 This idiosyncratic tradition offers a set of unique doctrines, such as ""eight consciousnesses and four aspects"" and “three natures,” which represents the Abhidharmic psychological wing of Yogācāra Buddhism. It offers a unique soteriological path by analyzing one’s cognitive process and subsequently acquire the divine cognition to perceive the “true nature” (buddha-nature, so-to-speak) of existence. The title of Xuanzang’s compendium expresses the central idea of this tradition—“merely consciousness.” Its philosophy draws a similarity with Kantian Transcendental Idealism, which asserts the world we human perceived is bonded by our epistemological limit and supported by a transcendental cognito, and Husserlian Phenomenology, which suspends the ontological inquiry and shifts to study and propose a universal cognitive structure that we human perceive experience. And therefore, nowadays, this tradition is commonly rendered as the Buddhist phenomenology, which contributed enormously to modern scientific disciplines, e.g. cognitive science, psychology, and science of mind.","Religious Group[8] -> Buddhist Traditions[14] -> Chinese Buddhist Traditions[65], Religious Group[8] -> Buddhist Traditions[14] -> Scholastic Buddhism[952], Religious Group[8] -> Buddhist Traditions[14] -> Yogācāra Buddhism[951], Religious Group[8], Religious Group[8] -> Buddhist Traditions[14]",Guanxiong Qi,1015,Major Yogācāra-driven monasteries during the early Tang period,"These are some major monasteries where Xuanzang and his dharma heirs held most of their translation projects, doctrinal debates, and religious activities.

2.1.2,964_NR,964_NR,964,"Religious Specialists, Non-elite (common people, general populace)",Baul Fakirs of Bengal,Database of religion history (DRH),"Baul Fakir (Bengali: bāul phakir) is a phrase used to describe decentralized and non-sectarian communities of sadhus, fakirs, and artists who most often come from either Hindu (most often Vaiṣṇava but sometimes Śaiva or Śākta) and Muslim families.
 

 Bāul Fakirs are generally decentralized as a society, and authority is organized according to various lines of descent from a guru or murshid (both guru and murshid are used synonymously among Bāul Fakirs). Gurus, their students, and their devotees (bhaktas) meet together during periodic gatherings called sādhusaṅga, “gathering of adepts,” where formal meals are held and decisions are often made on various issues of interest to the wider community of Fakirs (also called sādhaks or sādhus) and Fakirānis (also called sādhikās); these gatherings are often not only attended by Bāuls but also Hindu Tantric practitioners (tāntrikās) and followers of Sufi pīrs.
 

 Bāul Fakirs of all stripes are distinguished by their great reverence for the songs of Lālan Fakir (d. 1890, also commonly rendered Lalon Sai or Lalon Shah). Lālan is especially known for his criticism of sectarian religion or “birth group” (jāt) in his songs, early versions of which were later committed to writing and recorded in the notebooks of the celebrated poet and Nobel laureate Rabindranath Tagore (1861-1941). However, respect is also accorded to other important Bāul Fakiri poets, such as Pāñju Khondakār (1851-1914, also Pāñju Śāh), an associate of Lālan’s who seems to have contributed to the latter’s understanding of Islamic esoteric themes as well as his musical style of bhāb-saṅgīt “music for reflection.” The songs of Duddu Shah (1841-1911), one of Lālan’s direct disciples, as well as those of a wide variety of other artists as well as independent compositions are also commonly performed, but Lālan’s songs are often given preeminence at most festivals in Bangladesh, due in large part to his cultural status and familiarity. In West Bengal, however, the tradition appears to be more decentralized, and the songs of other Bāul poets such as Bhabā Pāglā (d. 1984) and Rāj Kr̥ṣṇa (1869-1946) as well as independent compositions are at least as prevalent as the songs of Lālan.
 

 The lyrics of Bāul songs accordingly contain references not only to Hindu Purāṇas but also to Sufi themes or symbols that relate to striving for the attainment (siddhi) of embodied self-realization, and to this end refer to practices as varied as reflecting on cosmology as expressed in terms of the Arabic alphabet and privately practicing sexual rites derived from medieval Tantric literature and syncretic oral tradition. The emphasis on the physical body has also led some scholars to view the community as having much in common with Lokāyata and Cārvāka beliefs on materialism.","Religious Group[8] -> Indic Religious Traditions[510] -> Bhakti traditions[512], Religious Group[8] -> Indic Religious Traditions[510] -> Indic Buddhist Traditions[513], Religious Group[8] -> Tantric Buddhism[993], Religious Group[8] -> Sufi[997], Religious Group[8] -> Syncretic Religions[806], Religious Group[8], Religious Group[8] -> Indic Religious Traditions[510] -> Islamic Traditions[661], Religious Group[8] -> Indic Religious Traditions[510] -> Hinduism[566], Religious Group[8] -> Indic Religious Traditions[510]",Keith Cantu,1111,"West Bengal, India and Bangladesh (Previously known as East Pakistan and portions of Bengal Presidency)","Portions of the colonial-era Bengal Presidency that include contemporary Bangladesh (previously East Pakistan) and West Bengal, India","South Asia[365], India[498], South Asia[365] -> Bangladesh[507]",NA,N,R,1,0,1,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,1,1,1,0,1,1,1,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,1,1,1,0,1,1,0,1,0,0,1,0,1,0,1,1,0,1,0,0
2.1.2,882_ENR,882_ENR,882,"Elite, Religious Specialists, Non-elite (common people, general populace)",Orphism,Database of religion history (DRH),"Orphism was a mystery cult of enduring perplexity: it is of obscure origin, vague doctrine, diverse practice, loose membership, and indeterminate extinction. Its sole fixture is the centrality of a canon of largely eschatological texts attributed by believers to the mythical Orpheus. The cult is attested textually in the mid 5th c. B.C. and archaeologically from the 4th c. B.C. to the 3rd A.D. The most extensive writings about it were by non-practitioners, principally Neoplatonists and Christians, writing centuries after the last archaeological evidence of its being practised. It may have had scattered adherents into the 4th c. A.D., as evidenced by the composition of the Orphic Argonautica. It appears not to have survived under the Christianization of the Roman Empire.
 

 | The very term “Orphism” appears to be an exonym, but it is accepted as a valid in so far as there were, according to Plato, missionaries called orpheotelestai, whom he portrays as charlatans, and Orphikoi, writers of Orphic texts. Modern scholarship on Orphism may be divided into minimalist and maximalist schools: the minimalist, predominant until the 1970’s, and represented by Willamowitz, defines Orphism as merely Orphic texts and teachers thereof, with no fixed doctrine; the maximalists, e.g. Graf and Johnston, as a community of eschatological belief coïnciding indefinitely with the cult of Dionysus, possessed of peculiar texts, rituals, initiators, initiates, and missionaries.  
 

  | The core of modern knowledge of Orphism is the Orphica, a body of poems of doubtful authorship, but which believers ascribed to Orpheus (non-believers explicitly doubted the attribution), whose matter treats with a distinct theogony and exchatology. Besides this are other texts of ritualistic nature, many shared with the Dionysian tradition. These texts are preserved principally in the Derveni papyrus (the oldest Greek papyrus, and one of the most remarkable ever discovered), and the diverse aureae lamellae (Golden Tablets), eminent among which is the Gold Leaf from Hipponium. They contain eighty-seven hexametric hymns, along with twenty-four rhapsodies.
 

 | Much of what is now taken to be Orphic doctrine was formalized by Neoplatonic philosophers in late antiquity, such as Proclus, Olympiodorus, and Damascius, who were writing long after new Orphica had ceased to be produced. In fact, it appears that multiple theogonies circulated among the Orphica, in the form of commentaries on the sacred texts. Their shared features, which are at most a vague approximation of what may inaccurately be termed Orphic doctrine, suggest a belief in man’s dual nature, viz., Titanic–wicked and Olympian–good; possibly, an original sin; almost certainly, a concern with initiation and ritual purity that would grant some form of afterlife and escape from rebirth and divine punishment.
 

 The teletai, or rituals of initiation, are unknown. As in contemporary mystery cults, the rites were probably known only to a specialist class. While the mysteries revealed at initiation do not appear in ancient sources, some idea of their nature may be formed from the Orphic texts. To judge from the opening of the Derveni papyrus, it is likely that initiation into the Orphic mysteries entailed learning the distinctive theogony presented in the literature. Plato’s references, the Orphic Argonautica, and the Lithica (on the magical properties of certain stones) strongly suggest a belief in purificatory magic.
 

 | In sum, if any essence of Orphism is to be found, it is in adherents’ belief that certain texts, mainly about theogony and eschatology, were composed by Orpheus and spoke the truth. The interpretation of these texts, as elsewhere in Greek religion, was not a matter of fixed doctrine.","Religious Group[8], Religious Group[8] -> Greek Religions[22] -> Greek Mystery Cults[745], Religious Group[8] -> Hellenistic Religions[741], Religious Group[8] -> Greek Religions[22]",Marshall Buchanan,1040,"Greece, Magna Graecia","The Hellenic and Hellenistic world, with archaeological evidence suggesting predominance in northern Greece.","Europe[3], Europe[3] -> Southeastern Europe[72], Europe[3] -> Southern Europe[73], Europe[3] -> Southern Europe[73] -> Greece[286], Europe[3] -> Southern Europe[73] -> Italy[288], Europe[3] -> Southern Europe[73] -> Italy[288] -> Sicily[370], Europe[3] -> Southern Europe[73] -> Italy[288] -> Rome[376]",E,N,R,1,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,1,1,0,1,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,1,1,0,1,0,1,0,0,1,1,0,1,1,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0

Although Unitarians and Universalists were nominally Christian denominations, the Unitarian Universalists subsequently adopted the principles of free faith, in which each member unites in seeking truth and affirms each other's worth without the guidance of a particular doctrine or divinity. Now described as a liberal religious movement or post-Christian, Unitarian Universalists hold many different theological opinions and operate as a radically non-creedal body. There is a wide diversity of congregational structures and organizations and each group may self-describe as a church, society, fellowship, or temple, among other identifiers. Each Unitarian Universalist congregation is distinct in tone and content of worship, even within the same city, but each is guided by the seven Principles and six Sources. The Principles serve as a uniting guide and affirm the inherent worth and dignity of every person; justice, equity, and compassion in human relations; acceptance of one another and encouragement to spiritual growth; a free and responsible search for truth and meaning; the right of conscience and the use of the democratic process without congregations and in society at large; the goal of world community with peace, liberty and justice for all; and respect for the interdependent web of all existence of which we are part. The Sources include direct experience, words and deeds of prophetic people, wisdom from the world’s religions, Jewish and Christian teachings to love our neighbors, humanist teachings and the guidance of reason and science, and spiritual teachings drawn from Earth-centered traditions. As a result, congregants draw from religious traditions such as Christianity or Judaism; spiritual practices of meditation, yoga, and connection to nature; and other influences including Paganism and New Age beliefs. Unitarian Universalists express strong commitment to social justice and action.

2.1.2,871_NR,871_NR,871,"Religious Specialists, Non-elite (common people, general populace)",Spiritualism,Database of religion history (DRH),"In 1948, young sisters Maggie and Katy Fox reported to their family that not only was there a spirit living in their house, but they’d learned how to communicate with it. Friends and neighbors around their house in upstate New York came to bear witness to the spirit’s “rappings,” the girls quickly became celebrity mediums, and the Spiritualist movement took off. 
 

 Spiritualism coalesced around a belief that the dead live on in a “spirit world” separated from the world of the living by a thin veil. In this spirit world, individual identities and personal connections persist, and the dead can continue to grow and to spiritually mature. The movement’s central practices include seances, trance lectures, mediumship, healings, and other modes of communication with the spirit world. The commercial success of events like public seances and products like Ouija boards have blurred the line between Spiritualism-as-entertainment and Spiritualism-as-religion from the tradition’s earliest days. Spiritualists also eschew central organization and have no formal markers of religious affiliation, so no precise figures exist for affiliation. However, scholars estimate that anywhere from 3 to 11 million Americans were participating in Spiritualism at the movement’s peak in the late 19th century.
 

 Drawing on previous religious traditions like Mesmerism, Swedenborgianism, and New Thought, Spiritualism followed in the iconoclastic footprints of other new religious movements that came out of the Burned-over District in the 19th century. Early Spiritualists denounced dogmatism and sectarianism of organized religion, and spoke out against the Calvinist notion that humankind is innately sinful. In turn, most Christian churches explicitly disavowed Spiritualism, warning congregants that it was a fraud – or worse, that it was witchcraft. Still, many Spiritualists have historically been practicing Christians, and some churches (especially Quaker, Universalist, and Unitarian churches) have either tacitly or even explicitly welcomed Spiritualism as an outgrowth of Christian practice. Some Spiritualists founded churches of their own, and several associations of Spiritualist Churches exist to this day. The movement also had strong ties to social reform movements, including abolition and women’s suffrage.
 

 Spiritualist practice was originally centered in the northern U.S., with another notable pocket of popularity around New Orleans. English-language periodicals, Spiritualist camps, and travelling mediums also connected American practitioners to a transnational network that grew to extend through Great Britain, parts of Canada. The movement was also briefly in vogue throughout continental Europe. Although Spiritualism experienced another surge of popularity in the wake of WWI, it has never regained its 19th century status in the religious and cultural mainstream.","Religious Group[8], Religious Group[8] -> New Religious Movement (NRM)[834]",Joanna Smith,1033,North America,"The majority of Spiritualist practitioners have been centered in the United States, Canada and the UK.","North America[61], North America[61] -> Canada[182], North America[61] -> United States of America[185], Scotland[422], England[399], Ireland[420]",NA,N,R,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,1,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,1,1,0,1,0,0,1,0,1,0,1,1,0,1,0,0

The Rastafari movement comprises a syncretic belief system combing Judeo-Christian tradition and imagery, African derived Jamaican peasant culture and spirituality, and a fierce political opposition to oppression and separation in favour of love and unity.  
 

 Variation of practices, specific beliefs and spiritual influences, understood within Rastafari as ‘livity’, are broad within a movement which is deeply anti-hierarchical and which has no central spiritually authoritative body. The movement is however orientated around attestation to the divine, divinely inspired or personally inspirational nature of His Imperial Majesty (HIM) Haile Selassie I (pre-regnal name Ras Tafari), Emperor of Ethiopia from 1930-1974. Largely a monotheistic movement, adherents refer to the divine creator (sometimes interpreted as HIM) as ‘Jah’, an interpreted rendering of ‘Jehovah’. 
 

 Haile Selassie became a figure of anti-colonial resistance and black assertiveness in colonised communities across the world after his coronation in 1930 which some saw as fulfilment of prophecy foretold by black nationalist Marcus Garvey of a black king who would lead black populations out of oppression and towards glory. Garvey himself built much of his rhetoric of black self-determination around Biblical sentiments, particularly Biblical allusions to 'Ethiopia' (esp. Psalms 68:31) which was interpreted broadly to refer to Africa as a whole. Ethiopia had also gained a reputation as the only non-colonised sovereign state on the continent of Africa having previously defeated Italian imperialists (most significantly at the Battle of Adowa 1896, a date commemorated by Rastafari annually). Haile Selassie then came to embody an anti-imperialist and anti-oppressive struggle many in the Caribbean were experiencing, and become the central focus of a new movement. This led many in the movement both in it’s formation and today to yearn towards a repatriation to the ‘motherland’ of Africa, or more specifically for some to Ethiopia and to Shashamane where Haile Selassie donated land for the repatriative efforts of those in the diaspora. 
 

 The notions here of resistance to oppression and injustice underpin Rastafari cosmologies and interactions with the world today. Rastafari frequently denounce the wickedness of ‘Babylon’ in contrast to ‘Zion’. ‘Babylon’ offers an interpretation of the industrial, colonial and post- colonial, Western reality as a subjugation of humanity in an existence defined by oppression and suffering. Conversely, the most divine locality of Zion represents a beacon of hope, freedom and a physical and spiritual repatriation to the place of The Almighty.
 

 An equally core element of Rastafari belief is an emphasis on the natural and the primordial in recognition that that which is most natural on this earth is most in accord with Jah’s original design for creation. This is conceptualised as ‘ital’ (from vital), a broad philosophical and ethical concept embodying a striving towards all in its most natural form.

2.1.2,991_N,991_N,991,"Non-elite (common people, general populace)",Beat Buddhism,Database of religion history (DRH),"‘Beat Buddhism’ refers to the intermediary period of experimentation with Buddhism by members of the Beat Generation (1944-1960s), most notably Jack Kerouac, Allen Ginsberg, and Gary Snyder, that preceded the emergence of popular institutional forms of convert communities in the United States which maintained religious and secular spaces for practice, like temples or meditation centers. Rather, the location of a uniquely Beat praxis of Buddhism originates from a literary tradition of exploration into ‘Oriental’ religions and mysticism first made possible by the American Romantic lineages of Transcendentalism and Theosophy in the 19th century. Although wrought with colonial assumptions about Asia; Transcendentalist writers, like Ralph Waldo Emerson and Henry David Thoreau, heavily influenced the Beats’ idealistic reinterpretation and socially-informed deployment of Buddhism, which attracted the attention of mainstream American readers for the first time in the Fifties. 
 The Beat Generation from which the distinctly Romantic, Protestant, and subterranean nature of Beat Buddhism arises, represents a subcultural movement that marks a watershed moment in the advancement of postmodernism in post-World War II America. The central elements of the Beat’s countercultural movement included the rejection of a status-quo maintained by traditional Christian values, a rejection of economic materialism, and a rejection of the stratification of classes based on socio-economic conformity. Instead, they sought out alternative American and Asian spiritual traditions on a quest for sexual liberation and human transcendence. In their radical pursuit of ‘satori’ (sudden enlightenment), a sudden experience of reality unfettered by the illusory restraints of dualism that appeared on the American landscape in the form of inequitable social norms, Beat Buddhism extends the discourse of D.T. Suzuki and Alan Watt’s, who repackaged Japanese Zen for American audiences by emphasizing the pure experience of the emptiness, or nondualism, of reality through the practice of living spontaneously. 
 Despite the non-institutional (or even anti-institutional) and transient foundation of Beat Buddhism as a religious interlocutor between the Orientalist exploration of Buddhism through the early-20th century, and the birth of convert communities in the United States; it contains several elements that can be identified as core beliefs and practices. First, Beat Buddhism is primarily concerned with the Four Noble Truths and how to overcome individual suffering within one’s current life. For Beats like Kerouac, Buddhism provided an ontology that explained suffering as the result of social ignorance and unrest. Second, drawing from Suzuki and Watts, Beat Buddhism is emphatically centered on experiencing what Kerouac coined “the golden eternity” or emptiness as a means of escape. Beat Buddhists believed that by training oneself to perform spontaneous acts of artistic expression, especially through “stream of consciousness” prose and poetry, one could experience their true (non) selves, unadulterated by the social baggage of 1950’s America. 
 Third, in a shortlist of main elements that characterize the Beats’ mobilization of Buddhism, is their romanticism of the mendicant or ascetic lifestyle. Phrases like “Zen-lunatics” and “rucksack revolution;” and hermit-like livelihoods requiring immersion with nature, like train-hopping, logging, sailing, and serving posts on fire lookouts, are idolized in the pages of Beat literature. Thus, Beat Buddhism, the quintessential form of American Buddhism from the Fifties and Sixties, maintains its lineage of textuality in which American Transcendentalism and Buddhism modernism intersect in a mutual clarion-call to rebel against the suffering caused by social conformism.","Religious Group[8], Religious Group[8] -> Buddhist Traditions[14] -> Japanese Buddhist Traditions[94] -> Zen Buddhism[989], Religious Group[8] -> Buddhist Traditions[14], Religious Group[8] -> Subaltern Religion[1038]",STEVEN QUACH,1149,"New York, California (predominately among a new generation of White, bohemian, writers and artists in New York City and San Francisco)","Jack Kerouac used the phrase “Beat Generation” in 1948 to characterize a subterranean, anti-conformist youth movement in New York; which first began, in large part, when founding members Kerouac, Allen Ginsberg, and William Burroughs began exchanging their ruminations on Buddhism in New York City. After the countercultural movement and Beat Buddhism gained momentum in Greenwich Village in the Fifties, Kerouac and Ginsberg solidified a space for Beat Buddhism in San Francisco’s bohemian and artistic community through the Sixties with the help of Gary Snyder. Although no longer extant today as an organized religious group, the legacy of Beat Buddhism is preserved in the Jack Kerouac School of Disembodied Poetics at Naropa University, Colorado.","United States[366], United States[366] -> New York[396], United States[366] -> California[495]",NA,N,NA,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,0,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0
2.1.2,826_N,826_N,826,"Non-elite (common people, general populace)","The Church of Christ, Scientist",Database of religion history (DRH),"The Church of Christ, Scientist, also known as Christian Science, is an American Christian restorationist religion and healing tradition founded by Mary Baker Eddy in 1879. Christian Science is predicated on what’s considered Eddy’s re-discovery of the divine healing ministry of Jesus Christ as an essential aspect of Christian life. After a lifetime of physical and mental suffering, Eddy founded Christian Science following a debilitating fall on the ice in Lynn, Massachusetts in 1866 referred to as the “Fall in Lynn”. During her period of recovery, she turned to the Bible for relief and later wrote her understanding of Jesus’ ministry in a text published in 1875 entitled Science and Health (later re-published as Science and Health with Key to the Scriptures). Eddy underscored the need for Christians to take part in healing both themselves and others and declared that the same works of healing demonstrated by Jesus were not miracles particular to his age but available to all Christians. Before writing Science and Health, Eddy was a student of New Thought leader Phineas Parkhurst Quimby. 
 

 During the turn of the 20th century, Christian Science rapidly attracted followers across the United States and later in Europe and Australia. Eventually the religion would spread to Asia and Africa, where it now has experienced its greatest growth. The religious practice of Christian Science is based on study of the King James version of the Bible and a large corpus of writings authored by Mary Baker Eddy, especially her work Science and Health which is considered the textbook of Christian Science. 
 

 In lieu of clergy, Christian Scientists instead view the Bible and Science and Health as their only “Pastor.” They are most well-known for engaging in healing by prayer rather than seeking allopathic medical care, although they are not forbidden as members of the Church from seeking medical attention. Christian Scientists employ prayer for healing and also hire professional healers in Christian Science known as practitioners. Christian Scientists are called to engage in the healing work of Jesus Christ by healing themselves and others through prayer alone. This prayer involves an understanding of God as Perfect Spirit and man as God’s perfect creation. Reality is interpreted as strictly metaphysical or Divine Spirit, and consequently, disease and matter are dismissed as unreal and lacking in “intelligence” and power. Christian Scientists interpret disease as the product of fear or erroneous thinking referred to as “mortal mind” and dismiss epidemiological interpretations of illness and contagion.
 

 In the United States, members of the Church of Christ, Scientist have historically labored through lobbying and other means of political redress to maintain what they consider their religious freedom to opt for care under a Christian Science practitioner or healer rather than seeking medical attention. Christian Science has therefore been influential in shaping the United States’ legal interpretation of religious freedom. Christian Scientists have been implicated in charges of child neglect and abuse in legal cases in which Christian Science parents opted to heal their children through prayer rather than seeking medical attention. Highly-publicized cases of this nature in the late 20th century brought significant negative attention to Christian Science.
 

 The Christian Science church is headquartered in Boston, Massachusetts and is known as the Mother Church. It is also the home of the Christian Science Publishing Society where the Christian Science Monitor, an internationally-recognized periodical, is published. The Church also publishes the Christian Science Journal and the Christian Science Sentinel. Both publications contain public testimonies of Christian Science healing. Christian Science churches hold two services each week, one on Sunday and another on Wednesday. Each is led by two readers, or appointed members of branch churches who read from both the King James Bible and Science and Health with Key to the Scriptures. The Wednesday service includes public testimony of healings. In addition to Christian Science branch churches, Christian Science Reading Rooms are operated in conjunction with each church as a “public face” to the religion and offer a place where members and non-members can access and purchase Christian Science literature. Reading Rooms are operated by Christian Science branch church volunteers. 
 

 Christian Science is considered a “science” or “divine science” in that the religion’s efficacy regarding healing is understood as demonstrable and repeatable. Christian Scientists additionally understand their faith as adhering to divine laws that supersede natural laws. When Eddy adopted the term science in the late 19th century, the term was in wider circulation and had broader connotations than today.","Religious Group[8], Religious Group[8] -> Christian Traditions[18] -> Christian Science[945], Religious Group[8] -> Christian Traditions[18], Religious Group[8] -> New Religious Movement[786]",Alexandra Prince,662,Global Smooth,World's major landmasses,Global[332],NA,N,NA,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,1,1,1,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0
2.1.2,908_E,908_E,908,Elite,Sino-Christian Theology,Database of religion history (DRH),"“Sino-Christian Theology” designates an academic, cultural, and theological movement that began in mainland China during the 1980’s, and that later developed in other Sinophone areas like Hong Kong and (to a lesser extent) Taiwan. Distinct from the official Chinese Patriotic Catholic Association (CPCA), Three-Self Patriotic Movement (TSPM), and the substantial evangelical, charismatic, and Neo-Calvinist movements, it represents a small, possibly waning, but altogether unique expression of Christianity in postsocialist China. // The term “Sino-Christian Theology” translates hanyu jidu shenxue, which literally means “Han-language Christian theology.” Most commonly, it refers to an intellectual wave inaugurated by the work of Liu Xiaofeng and He Guanghu, both professors at Renmin University who have since become quasi-canonized as its “church fathers.” While the movement has diversified over its decades-long development, three broad features remain. Sino-Christian Theology: is written in Chinese; emphasizes the contemporary situation; and prioritizes universities (rather than churches or seminaries) as the primary site for knowledge production. // Conventionally, Sino-Christian Theologians tend to be “Cultural Christians” (wenhua jidutu), i.e. Christians who do not profess “personal faith” in Christianity or who are not regular, church-going attendees. As far as the Chinese public and even most scholars are concerned, Sino-Christian Theology and Chinese Cultural Christianity are virtually synonymous. “China’s Apollos,” “China’s Nicodemus,” and “Scholars in Mainland China Studying Christianity” (SMSC) are other appellations that have been used to describe the movement. // Sino-Christian Theologians have tended to approach theology from within the disciplines of literature, philosophy, and various social sciences. Yang Huilin sees the movement as closer to Religious Studies than Theology (as conceived in the West), while Chloe Starr observes that Sino-Christian Theology constitutes a “theorizing of theology itself.” // There are three primary contexts in which Sino-Christian Theology has arisen. The first, as Fredrik Fallman observes, concerns the broader Chinese quest for modernity. Since China’s humiliating defeats by foreign imperialists during the so-called “Century of Humiliation”, Chinese intellectuals have labored to reform China and re-negotiate its place in the new global world order. Not unlike Republican-era Christians like Wu Leichuan and Zhao Zichen, Sino-Christian Theologians turn to Christian resources to address China’s ongoing aspirations to modernize. The second, following Starr, locates the movement within larger globalizing trends of the world-wide church. Alongside Black American, Korean Minjung, and various postcolonial theologies, Sino-Christian Theology represents the continuing Chinese attempt to forge a Christianity that does dialogical, liberational justice to contextual sociocultural realities. The post-Mao Reform Era constitutes the third context. The movement arose due to the relaxation of restrictions in virtually all spheres of life, whether economic, political, or religious. But despite this relative “opening up,” certain fundamental strictures of the state remain, whether in its official socialist-atheistic ideology or overarching materialist-economic aspirations.

During this time, as they were adapting to life in a new country, religion remained an important factor. In the early 1900s, Sikhs remained adamant in wanting to retain their culture and religion. In a 1910 article, “The Tide of the Turbans,” Herman Scheffauer, a German-American journalist, notes that:
 

 “It was the same son of India who, wishing to become a citizen of the United States, refused to remove his turban while taking the oath and so remained a British subject. Always the turban remains, the badge and symbol of their native land, their native customs and religion. Whether repairing tracks on the long stretches of the Canadian or Northern Pacific railways, feeding logs into the screaming rotary saws of the lumber-mills, picking fruit in the luxuriant orchards or sunny hillsides of California, the twisted turban shows white or brilliant, a strange, exotic thing in the western landscape.”
 As decades went by, Sikhs’ mentality about Sikhism adapted. By the mid-1940s, Sikhs at Stockton Gurdwara introduced chairs inside the gurdwara, so worshippers were not required to sit on the floor. The community even dropped the requirements for people to remove their shoes and cover their heads when they enter the gurdwara. If one was to walk inside Stockton Gurdwara, the physical space would resemble the inside of a church more than a gurdwara. Bruce LaBrack notes that this is “because they were better educated and more at ease in the American culture milieu [and] began to question some of the practices associated with Sikh Worship.” Sikh practices were classified by Sikhs of this time as “backward and unnecessarily strict interpretations of gurdwara etiquette,” which is completely different than the terminology and spirit of the first wave of immigrants. With the Immigration Act of 1965 allowing more Sikhs to immigrate to the United States, Sikhism reverted back to its more traditional form. Following the 9/11 attacks, many Sikhs have been victims of hate crimes throughout the United States mainly due to two things: the color of their skin and their turbans. As a matter of fact, the first victim of a hate crime in the aftermath of 9/11 was Balbir Singh Sodhi, a Sikh. Despite the struggle they face in America, Sikhs remain resilient. Today, the number of Sikhs in the United States has grown to over 500,000 with a number of new non-Punjabi converts joining the faith – mainly through the Healthy, Happy, Holy Organization (3HO) started by Harbhajan Singh also known as “Yogi Bhajan.” Throughout the entire history of Sikhs in the United States, their faith continues to be a key component. This section will look at Sikhism in the United States from when they first immigrated in 1899 to the present day.","Religious Group[8], Religious Group[8] -> Sikhism[44], Religious Group[8] -> Asian American Religions[950]",Tejpaul Singh Bainiwal,1018,USA,The United States of America,"North America[61], North America[61] -> United States of America[185], United States[366], United States[366] -> Lower 48[400]",NA,N,NA,1,1,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,1,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,0,1,0,1,1,1,1,0,0,1,1,1,0,1,1,1,0,1,0
2.1.2,570_ENR,570_ENR,570,"Elite, Religious Specialists, Non-elite (common people, general populace)",Supreme Master Ching Hai World Society,Database of religion history (DRH),"As Ching Hai initiates do not prefer to speak of their community as religious, it may be more precise to describe Suma Ching Hai as a transnational cybersect primarily composed of diasporic East and Southeast Asians. Suma Ching Hai is inseparable from a vast mediascape of online lectures, videos, chat groups, commercial enterprises and tightly-controlled official messaging. Sum Ching Hai is also a New Religious Movement that blends together aspects of Hinduism, Buddhism, Christianity and messianic theology. The charisma of the Supreme Leader Ching Hai, called Thanh Hải in Vietnamese, binds the community together. She is often revered by initiates as partly divine, as a perfected being who preaches the proper meditation style (Quan Yin Method) and spreads compassion and the uplift of spiritual consciousness. Born in Vietnam, raised in the West and now based in Taiwan, Ching Hai teaches a syncretistic theology. Based on her time in India, she incorporates Sant Mat traditions, Surat Shabd Yoga (emphasizing divine sound and light), and Radhasoami as practiced in Beas. There are many similar theological touch points: 2 1/2 hours of required daily meditation; spiritual progression through stages of consciousness; abilities to experience astral planes; and total devotion on the spiritual master as an aspect of divinity. Practitioners of Ching Hai are given initiation after watching and summarizing (in written essays) 90 lectures of Ching Hai (available online) and practicing vegetarianism for at least 3 months. They are initiated by either Ching Hai herself or, more likely, by about twenty disciples who are authorized to perform initiations. Children of initiates are given ""half initiation"" at 6 and ""full initiation"" at 12 based on their spiritual advancement. Practice of Ching Hai depends on region: in Southeast Asia (Cambodia, Laos, Vietnam especially) and China, governments have branded Ching Hai as an ""evil cult"" and news stories abound about confiscations of illegal religious material or cult-like forms of psychological manipulation of initiates. In Vietnam, for example, Thanh Hải followers in Hanoi do so surreptitiously, with fear of government reprisal. Their meditation center is secret. Conversely, Thanh Hải followers in Ho Chi Minh City are building an official meditation center and do not live under the same shroud of fearful secrecy. Besides official adherents, there are many people who practice Quan Yin Method privately and consume online material related to Ching Hai without identifying explicitly with a community or even community of faith. The global community of Ching Hai followers could be briefly summarized as bounded together by a range of theological beliefs, meditation practices and forms of digital consumption. Significant communities exist in Taiwan (called Qinghai Wushang Shijie Hui), where the main headquarters were established in 1986. Of Vietnamese origin, several thousand are practitioners and refer to Ching Hai affectionately as Chi Hai (""eldest sister"" in Vietnamese). Other concentrated populations of practitioners are in mainland China (although banned officially), South Korea, Singapore, Indonesia, Japan and California. Based on five normative precepts -- which includes not taking life and eating a vegan diet -- non-initiates of a vegan persuasion may discover this NRM by visiting one of 160 or so Loving Hut restaurants -- from Prague to Hanoi to San Jose -- where they will be exposed to Ching Hai's spiritually-infused artwork on the walls and her teachings beaming through 24 hour satellite TV. A cursory glance through online and printed media highlights the importance of veganism and these restaurants in shaping the public perception of Ching Hai (which is sometimes branded a ""Vegan Cult"" in Vice, for example).","Religious Group[8] -> Christian Traditions[18] -> ""Divine Presence"" Christian Snycretism[832], Religious Group[8], Religious Group[8] -> Buddhist Traditions[14], Religious Group[8] -> Christian Traditions[18], Religious Group[8] -> Indic Religious Traditions[510], Religious Group[8] -> Indic Religious Traditions[510] -> Hinduism[566], Religious Group[8] -> Indic Religious Traditions[510] -> Hinduism[566] -> Sant Mat[828], Religious Group[8] -> Indic Religious Traditions[510] -> Hinduism[566] -> Surat Shabd Yoga[829], Religious Group[8] -> Buddhist Traditions[14] -> Cybersect Buddhism[830], Religious Group[8] -> Buddhist Traditions[14] -> Quan Yin Method[831], Religious Group[8] -> New Religious Movement (NRM)[834]","Stephen Christopher, Nan Ouyang",806,"Transnational Cybersect, East/Southeast Asia, California (predominately among Chinese and Vietnamese diasporic communities)","The regions in East/Southeast Asia and the United States most associated with Suma Ching Hai (Chinese: Guanyin Famen; Vietnamese: Thanh Hải Vô Thượng Sư).

This religious movement advocated for the restoration of the kingdom of Kongo through a spiritual approach grounded on local beliefs and practices, and the rejection of western (missionary) beliefs system perceived as ideological and deleterious to the unity and greatness of the kingdom of Kongo. Kimpa Vita believed that God was not white. She also believed that she was the reincarnation of saint Anthony and used these claims to promote the restoration of a unified and powerful Kingdom of Kongo. The deeper issue behind Kimpa Vita's claims was the idea of ""inculturation"" i.e. christian ideals and values must be understood and interpreted through Kongolese cultural paradigms in order to restore and strengthen the unity of the Kongolese kingdom. Her teaching attracted many followers and ultimately became a threat to the missionaries. She was burnt alive by missionaries in 1706. Despite her death and the collapse of the kingdom of Kongo, Kimpa Vita's spiritual and political intuitions (ideas) are embraced by many African and Congolese people who still perceive her as a prefigure to inculturation and Afrocentrist movements. Nowadays, Kimpa Vita's movement continues in a different way through the ""Ngunza religion"" from Congo-Brazzaville. The Ngunzas venerate and practice a ritual dedicated to Kimpa Vita.

They find definitive mentions in written sources, such as the Ahom Buranjis of the Ahom kingdom in Assam, from approximately 12th-15th centuries AD. They are listed as a Scheduled Tribe but are attempting to get 6th Schedule status. The 6th Schedule is a Government of India legislation that provides tribal autonomy in judicio-administrative proceedings of areas designated as Scheduled Areas. 
 

 The community speaks Mising, a Tibeto-Burman language which is seen by several scholars to mark its migratory connection with the Sino-Tibetan and Tibeto-Burman region. They also speak Assamese. 
 

 The Mising inhabit the Brahmaputra river valley along its northern bank covering several districts. This particular entry covers the Mising community living in small river islands known as the char region in Lakhimpur District, Assam. Surrounded by the Subansiri tributary of the River Brahmaputra, the chars are erosional spaces, some of which are submerged with the lashing of the floods each monsoon in the months of June and July. This char region is physically removed from areas across the river and require travel by ferries. 
 

 The religion ascribed to by respondents from the river island area is understood as a mixture of Mising religious practices that focus on nature worship and Hinduism, specifically Vaishnavite Hindu practices. There is mention of the Vaishnava tradition being the first indicator of a conversion to Hinduism due to the popularity of the same in the region. The Neo-Vaishnavite movement in Assam which is linked to spiritual leader Srimanta Sankardeva around15th century CE is often proclaimed as a socially 'integrative' and 'assimilative' force which saw tribal communities such as the Mising converting to Vaishnavism. 
 

 The community continues to practice nature worship through several rituals honoring Donyi and Polo, referring to the sun and moon respectively. Among other forces worshipped are asu(water), among(earth), asar(wind).
  
 In 2019, there was seen to be a push amongst certain river island communities towards an increased emphasis on Donyi-Polo worship.

As a form of North Indian bhakti (devotion), the sampradaya follows Krishna as Shrinathji (as well as his other forms though focus is on his childhood). Vallabhacarya did not preach a life of asceticism or renunciation. His monistic philosophy was called Shuddhadvaita (pure non-dualism) where the focus is on the Supreme Being as personal, with the potential of developing a relationship. The Pushtimarg is a householder sampradaya (community) and therefore generating wealth and having a family are important parts of Krishna's world that he created for his lila (play). 
 

 Historically, the popularity of the bhakti movement in India was twofold; “One the one hand, bhakti bypassed the hierarchy and ritualism of the Vedic sacrifices, monopolised by Brahmans and sponsored by their wealthy twice-born patrons, by teaching that salvation was open to all, regardless of caste, wealth, or sex, through the sincere and spontaneous expression of love for the divine. On the other hand, bhakti provided a more practicable alternative to the disciplined path followed by the renouncer” (Bennett 1993; 2). 
 

 The community is dispersed globally, from Mozambique to Australia. In the 1990s, Pushtimarg gurus (who are called goswamis and are descendants of Vallabhacharya) began to travel more frequently to the diasporas around the US and Europe though this trend came relatively late compared to other forms of North Indian Krishna worship (e.g. Hare Krishna or ISKCON and the Swaminarayan faith).","Religious Group[8], Religious Group[8] -> Vaishnavism[896]",Anishka Gheewala Lohiya,1042,Gujarat and the UK,Gujarat and the diaspora around the UK,"Bhakti[340], Hinduism[339], South Asia[365], England[399]",E,N,R,1,1,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,0,1,1,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,0,1,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,1,1,0,1,1,1

The Veerashaiva path of devotion or bhakti was one that sought to remind its society that the mechanical performance of ritual would not help achieve 'arivu' or understanding. Arivu, led to the cessation of the cycle of birth and death. They also reminded the people around them that for moksha and for sadhana (striving towards it), all were equal, irrespective of class, caste and gender. Quite spontaneously, a number of people from different castes and communities followed this path of devotion and charted their self-transformation through a spontaneous verbalization of experience known as vachanas or simply, speech. Some describe the self-transormation in terms of six phases or Shatsthalas, which are Bhaktasthala, (2) Maheshsthala, (3) Prasadisthala, (4) Pranalingi Sthala, (5)
 Sharanasthala and (6) Aiykasthala. 
 

 Together, the Veerashaiva saints of the 12th century founded the Anubhava Mantapa, a forum for the discussion of experience, in the city of Kalyana, northern Karnataka. Anubhava literally means experience. Prominent figures of this mode of bhakti are Allama Prabhu, Basavanna, Akka Mahadevi, Soole Sankavva, Ayadakki Maramma, Devara Dasimayya and others. 
 

 The vachanas explicate a yogic path and are essentially oral literature. The Veerashaivas are said to have emerged from earlier Shaivite sects such as the Kaalamukha and their tradition derives much from the Agamas. Many devotees of the Veerashaiva tradition took to expressing their devotion through madhura bhava (known specifically within the tradition as satipati bhava) or, love for the chosen deity and through surrender or sharanagati. The philosophy of surrender led to the Veerashaiva devotees to become known as 'shivasharanas.' For the Veerashaivas, Shiva is composed of Guru (teacher), Linga (abstract form of Shiva) and Jangama (guru with no attachments). The Veerashaivas believe in qualified monism or qualified non-dualism. 
 

 Although the Veerashaivas expressed devotion in filial terms, their approach was largely renunciatory. They, however, did not quit society like other renunciants but instead stayed within and continued their duties. This continuation of the performance of labour but dedicating it from the beginning till end to the deity, Shiva, they considered as kayaka.","Religious Group[8], Religious Group[8] -> Indic Religious Traditions[510] -> Bhakti traditions[512], Religious Group[8] -> Indic Religious Traditions[510], Religious Group[8] -> Indic Religious Traditions[510] -> Hinduism[566]",Sushumna Kannan,826,"Karnataka, India, Andhra Pradesh, India",Karnataka is well known for the Vijayanagara Empire which was established in 1336.,"Asia[1], Asia[1] -> South Asia[40], Asia[1] -> South Asia[40] -> Karnataka[375]",NA,N,NA,1,1,1,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,{01},0,{01},0,1,1,0,1,{01},1,1,1,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,{01},0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,1,0,1,0,0,1,1,0,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,0,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,0,1
